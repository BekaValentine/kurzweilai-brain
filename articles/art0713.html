            </i></p>
          <p>We&#8217;re neither economic forecasters nor political prognosticators by trade, but you don&#8217;t have to be either to see that right now the U.S. holds a robust lead in the race for hegemony. Our economy is five times as large as
            China&#8217;s and 15 times larger than India&#8217;s, with about one-fourth the population of either nation. That gives the U.S. a real advantage in providing <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>,
            health care, and national security&#8212;plus all the other stuff that makes a country thrive. <br>
            <br>
            But &#8220;right now&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean forever. All you need is a ruler to draw the straight-line extrapolation showing that China and India, with their faster <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>
            rates, will eventually catch up to the U.S. in terms of pure economic size. For China, that would occur as early as 2045; for India, the date would be some 20 years later. Which is why you so often hear experts predicting that, by
            midcentury, the U.S. will be trailing the two new world superpowers. <br>
            <br>
            We'd say: Not so fast. Straight-line calculations about the U.S., China, and India are just that. They assume all three national will enjoy smooth upward rides. No recessions, no banking breakdowns, not political crisis, no disruptive
            social uprisings. Unlikely? For sure! With China's massive <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> combining communism and <a class="thought" href="entries/capitalism_entry.html">capitalism</a>,
            India's entrenched bureaucracy and corruption, and America's long term entitlement obligations, it is far more probable that growth trajectories will zig and zag more than zoom. Further, straight-line calculations do not take into
            account relationships with other parts of the world, such as the Middle East, where changing alliances could have economic repercussions.<br>
            <br>
            Given that <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, then, what general scenario would you bet on for the next 50 years? Would it be America&#8217;s 3% annual growth or China and India
            at 8%? We&#8217;d take the U.S. for a simple yet incontrovertible <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. Its <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>&#8212;the
            sum of all its parts&#8212;works, and when it breaks, it bounces back fast. Don&#8217;t worry; we&#8217;re not breaking into The <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">Star</a>-Spangled Banner. We
            just believe U.S. economic dominance isn&#8217;t a function of how long the nation has been leading the pack. <br>
            <br>
            It&#8217;s about how America operates as a country. We&#8217;re talking, mainly, about <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> and stability. Political parties disagree, often
            vehemently, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> never stops running. Generally speaking, the U.S. justice system is fair, and health care, while inconsistent in
            delivery, is widely available. And even though secondary education in America gets roundly knocked, we have without doubt the best system of higher education, turning out the world&#8217;s most skilled, innovative <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>
            and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering PhDs. <br>
            <br>
            America has a final competitive advantage as powerful as it is unique: its confluence of bright, hungry <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s and flush, eager investors.
            Yes, China and India have ambitious people who <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of building their own companies, and, increasingly, more are getting the chance. (The U.S. venture
            firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers just opened offices in Shanghai and Beijing.) But neither China nor India comes close to the U.S. in terms of this &#8220;killer app,&#8221; and it will take years of <a class="thought" href="entries/venture_capital_entry.html">venture
              capital</a> flowing in before the Chinese let go of a rote approach to work and truly embrace entrepreneurial innovation. <br>
            <br>
            China has other challenges as well. Aside from its risky social experiment, it has an economy in which less than a quarter of its people truly participate, and its one-child policy is exacerbating the problems of an already aging
            population. India, meanwhile, will continue to struggle with its overwhelming <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of have-nots and its aforementioned corruption. True, India is a
            democracy, but a democracy muddled by a profusion of divergent political parties. <br>
            <br>
            Now, we&#8217;re not saying the U.S. system is perfect or its economy invulnerable. If not dealt with, entitlements like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will create a budget deficit that will explode over the next 20 years. How
            America handles that problem via tax and spending policies will determine the strength of its growth engine. Fortunately, our stable, highly adaptable system has conquered enough major problems&#8212;from the Depression to the Cold
            War&#8212;in the past that there is more reason for <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> than despair. <br>
            <br>
            In the end, we&#8217;d make the case that American economic leadership will be with us for most, if not all, of the century. It will by no means &#8220;rule,&#8221; as it did at the turn of the 21st century. But it will remain ahead
            until other nations develop a total economic and social system that works as well. There&#8217;s a lot more to the world&#8217;s economic <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> than a
            straight-line extrapolation can tell you.<br>

                <p>I wouldn't argue with the main idea of the article: The US can expect to be #1 economically for some time to come. But I would point out what Fareed Zakaria has pointed out: 1. We have a dysfunctional political system more
                  interested in scoring points as a Democrat or Republican than in doing serious work to create change in the 'rules' that would keep us competitive. We have the 2nd highest tax structure in the world. 2. Medicaid, Medicare and SS
                  are threatening to bankrupt us. 3. We have known since the 70's that we had 'energy' issues and Washington has done nothing, nada, to solve these and we are in a war because of it. We have no nuclear power program, we aren't
                  building enough refineries, we don't drill enough off our own shores (ala Brazil), we've been suckered by the agricultural industry into using food stuff to create ethanol and our big three auto manufacturers seem to need a 2x4
                  right between the eyes to see what's right in front of their noses.
                  <br>
                  We need a radical overhaul of our medical system - NOT a government takeover but an infusion of freedom into a fascistic system that drives prices through the stratosphere.
                  <br>
                  There is much to be done if we don't want to find ourselves with an impoverished life style much less staying #1. </p>

                <p>Although the surface data seems accurate, this entire article is absolutely riddled with mis-representations and bogus language- it is flawed from beginning to end and I would say is nothing more than either one persons dream wish

                  collapse our country's economy in one day of currency trading (wouldn't do it, but could) - so could Japan for that matter. As for a stable, highly adaptable systems - this is BS language. The US is no more or less "stable" or
                  adjustable than either one. I'd say MORE unstable socially if ONLY because China has no religion (monotheism = division) or large gap racial diversity (at least very little to almost no effect). While these two points I made may be
                  offensive to small minds, it is, never the less, a reality. Homogeneous societies tend to be, well, more homogeneous :-) While they have their own fair share of issues, I'd boldly say that the ones they do have are fixable -
                  multi-ethnic and religious diversity isn't something you can "fix" it remains a constant source of conflict - always. There NEVER has been a time or place or empire or country where it has not been so - even in America. This is
                  just fact. Mankind is not there yet. As a matter of fact, this "diversity" in America is the SINGLE MOST polarizing and dividing factor in our economical, social and political system - and becoming more so by the month if you watch
                  what's going on now in our political arenas (immigration mainly). Sad, but true. So you can take the entire opening paragraph of this "article" and toss it out as wishful thinking and as setting a false tone for effect (propaganda
                  I say).

                    <p class="mindxquote"> We're neither economic forecasters nor political prognosticators by trade, but you don't have to be either to see that right now the U.S. holds a robust lead in the race for hegemony. Our
                      economy is five times as large as China's and 15 times larger than India's, with about one-fourth the population of either nation. That gives the U.S. a real advantage in providing education, health care, and
                      national security'plus all the other stuff that makes a country thrive. </p>

                  <br>
                  That's for sure :-) What is hegemony? You'll love this, James J: "A concept of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) which refers to the way that the political and social domination of the bourgeois class" - haha, pretty
                  funny stuff! I mean, I can't stop laughing! It also means: "The theory that those in power maintain domination through cultural influence rather than force. Cultural agencies such as the media privilege dominant ideologies (that
                  serve to disguise the realities of social injustice) which prevail over other competing or alternative ideas", or even "Most simply, hegemony is a state of leadership where a large group of people are dominated by an individual or
                  by a smaller group of people. In this class, it refers more specifically to the ideologies which control the thoughts and behaviours of most people in a large social group". In this particular case, they must be alluding to the US
                  hegemony over other countries economies without the use of force, but via ideological mechanisms. This is horse sh*t language again. I mean, are these people trained like circus animals to use this type of language? I think we had
                  a thread on the power of language earlier, didn't we? America's economic hold over other countries is through a multitude of mechanisms, some through political and ideological manipulation of facts, news and influence over other
                  state leaders, but, primarily,as evidenced by recent events, through the use of its military to enforce its economic dominion and use of its military to protect the corprations that rape third world countires on a regular basis
                  (Nigeria a great example - although we pay the Nigerian corrupt gov't to use THEIR military to kill off the "rebels" protecting their lands from exploitation). Anyway, I could go on - this is all more BS. China, on the other hand,
                  immigrates to Africa and so on, establishing very strong SOCIAL ties and ONLY contribute funds and donations to civic improvements. US of A? MOSTLY contributes to militaries and dictatorships! Also a fact. ONLY exception is the
                  PRIVATE American Non-profit Aid orgs that donate otherwise. Who's backwards? Who's building a long term relationship that works? See the news? We are at constant WAR. Is China? Hmmm. Hegemony? Double talk.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As for the US having an advantage in education, health care, national security? Do I really need to say anything here? I mean, PLEEEAAASSE! That's a joke. The writers of this article are really full of themselves and people who
                  believe this type of propaganda are the REASON WHY America is going down the toilet. Thriving? You must be kidding. DENIAL. 12 step program is what they need :-)

                    <p class="mindxquote"> But 'right now' doesn't mean forever. All you need is a ruler to draw the straight-line extrapolation showing that China and India, with their faster growth rates, will eventually catch
                      up to the U.S. in terms of pure economic size. For China, that would occur as early as 2045; for India, the date would be some 20 years later. Which is why you so often hear experts predicting that, by mid century, the U.S.
                      will be trailing the two new world superpowers.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      We'd say: Not so fast. Straight-line calculations about the U.S., China, and India are just that. They assume all three national will enjoy smooth upward rides. No recessions, no banking breakdowns, not political crisis, no
                      disruptive social uprisings. Unlikely? For sure! With China's massive experiment combining communism and capitalism, India's entrenched bureaucracy and corruption, and America's long term entitlement obligations, it is far more
                      probable that growth trajectories will zig and zag more than zoom. Further, straight-line calculations do not take into account relationships with other parts of the world, such as the Middle East, where changing alliances
                      could have economic repercussions. </p>
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  The assumptions about banking crises, recessions, disruptive social uprisings, political crises and so on are good points, but I'd say that here again, America is in a long period of increasing social, political and economic
                  crises, whereas China (primarily in this case) is experiencing an upsurge in unity, has no real political counter (it's taken care of quickly), and is socially homogeneous for the most part. three minuses versus three pluses. It is
                  math. Yes, all countries will "zig-zag", but this is also empty language meant to unfocus the reader. As for the Middle East changing alliances? Whatever they do, it will not be in our favor - never has, never will. That was funny
                  too. Other relationships? US strong arms everyone except England (because this is an English country with English leadership still, duh.) - China, yes, it USED to. now, they are quite more tactful and "charitable" - leading many to
                  lean in their direction - mostly, the resource rich third world countries. Dire for us. I'd pay close attention and be wary of the type of language used by people like these "writers".

                    <p class="mindxquote"> Given that reality, then, what general scenario would you bet on for the next 50 years? Would it be America's 3% annual growth or China and India at 8%? We'd take the U.S. for a simple yet
                      incontrovertible reason. Its system'the sum of all its parts'works, and when it breaks, it bounces back fast. Don't worry; we're not breaking into The Star-Spangled Banner. We just believe U.S.
                      economic dominance isn't a function of how long the nation has been leading the pack.

                      It's about how America operates as a country. We're talking, mainly, about freedom and stability. Political parties disagree, often vehemently, but the government never stops running. Generally speaking, the U.S.
                      justice system is fair, and health care, while inconsistent in delivery, is widely available. And even though secondary education in America gets roundly knocked, we have without doubt the best system of higher education,
                      turning out the world's most skilled, innovative science and engineering PhDs. </p>

                  WOW! It's all I can say. This IS a propaganda rant. "Given this reality"? First they feed you nonsense, then refer to it as back up for their arguments!!! You must be a fool to swallow this. WHO ARE these people? The entire
                  paragraph is more rubbish talk. Freedom? Stability? Gov't never stops running (well that's true - but not for us). Fair justice system? Yeah, it usually is, although its getting bad recently and over zealous in its "powers". Our
                  education system being the best? Total lie. Lies, lies.

                    <p class="mindxquote"> What we are witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or a passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution
                      and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of humangovernment.
                      <br>

                  Thanks to Equsnarnd, jpmjpm and SallyM for their comments.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Welch offers a global overview and prediction of the economic future. He is probably wrong, given that most predictions are wrong.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  I started with another prediction, Fukuyama's 'End of History'. Fukuyama assumes we are all men of good will, and having recognized that Western liberal democracy is the best form of government, it will be the
                  final form of government. He assumes too much.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Political and ideological struggles are not over, and liberal democracy certainly is not triumphant. I don't know if Man v. State will always be the latest thing, but it is now. Fascist (see note below on my use of this
                  word) forces now seek a third way to their personal continued economic prosperity and power. In China, the Communist Party has loosened constrains on economic activity while maintaining despotic political control. In Russia, after
                  the Fall, there was near anarchy, with thugs preying on civil society. Today, the thugs have taken control. Some economic activity is permitted, but politics becomes relentlessly more despotic. The major resources, the sources of
                  real money, are firmly in the hands of the thugocracy.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  But it the U.S. that is the main arena in this time of struggle. Gramsci's long march through the institutions nears completion. The schools, the media, cinema, foundations, unions (especially public sector) and one major
                  political party are now all neo-Marxist. Welch praises our Universities, and good technical education can be had there, but they are truly 'oasis's' of fascism, with utterly anti-intellectual party-line
                  thinking ruthlessly enforced. Much of what passes as education is indoctrination. Check out Mind-X to witness the fruits.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This has led to, basically, a cold civil war in the U.S. And the division is not merely a matter of a disagreement of opinion. The divide goes to the very nature of morality, Man, and, well, Nature. One side is grounded in reality,
                  the other an alternate reality, because they both can't be true. With a divide so great, neither facts, history or even the meanings of words can be agreed upon.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Consider MekA's response above. Apparently, the U.S. invaded Iraq to steal the oil and funnel contracts to Halliburton, in order to fund the great globalist war machine and further the interests of the ruling class. And
                  Welch, one of the greatest, most sophisticated businessmen in history, doesn't just lie -- he 'lies, lies, lies'!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In the US we cannot develop oil shale nor drill most of Northern Alaska or much of the off-shore. Mining is almost hopeless. Logging -- leave it the Canadians. Want to go public? Go to London or live with Sarbanes-Oxley and risk
                  jail. To protect the Earth we burn our corn. Want to build a coal fired power plants in Kansas? Forget about it ' CO2 is poisoning the planet. When asked why he would raise capital gains taxes when it is known it will
                  decrease tax revenues, our most like next president replied 'social justice'. GM is dying. No more big SUV's or Hummers.

                  Congressman Paul Ryan (R, Wi) has proposed a legislative road map to reform our tax system, entitlement programs, health care, and make everyone in America rich in a generation or two by privatizing social security. His proposals
                  would go a long way toward revitalizing America. The proposal is dead on arrival. Link:

                  Note on the word 'fascism'. Technically, the word fascism originates from the Italian r'gime of that name. However, the word gained wider meaning when Stalin's communists started calling everything to
                  the 'right' of communism fascism. Today, it is appropriate to use the word to describe any theory of power to the left of socialism, up to and including the various forms of totalitarianism.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  History itself is a reflection of man's ever-evolving pursuit of power, glory, identity, god, love, (insert "value" here, if 10 = 6 then go to 4) :-)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  One thing for you RQ:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <center>
                    <p class="mindxquote"> This has led to, basically, a cold civil war in the U.S. And the division is not merely a matter of a disagreement of opinion. The divide goes to the very nature of morality, Man, and, well, Nature. One
                      side is grounded in reality, the other an alternate reality, because they both can't be true. With a divide so great, neither facts, history or even the meanings of words can be agreed upon. </p>
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  Both ARE true - in the minds of those dreaming them up - ideas, morals, and so on. The divide is due in largest part, not one groups conspiracy, but a collective effort by many groups and individuals to secure their personal power
                  and wealth, and most knowingly at the cost of others freedom, wealth and even lives. Religion, politics, race, creed, democracy (whatever) are all too often simply "words" / "tools" to justify the separation of causes and allow
                  profiteering in this constant state of conflict. The below reference to my statement is a perfect example!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <center>
                    <p class="mindxquote"> Consider MekA's response above. Apparently, the U.S. invaded Iraq to steal the oil and funnel contracts to Halliburton, in order to fund the great globalist war machine and further the interests of
                      the ruling class. And Welch, one of the greatest, most sophisticated businessmen in history, doesn't just lie -- he 'lies, lies, lies'! </p>
                  </center>
                  <br>
                  This is, in essence the very reason WHY we went - it is not an emotional rant, it is a fact. The persons in the back room, looking to profit, had every motive and every ABILITY to make sure that we went to war. They, I dare say,
                  are in well control of the US foreign policies. "They" are groups of profiteers. IT has ALWAYS BEEN SO, since the first empire on Earth. Why any one questions this is proof of indoctrination vs education. A small caveat: I trade,
                  buy and sell OIL. It is my business (one of them :-) I also know many people in position of political influence (for lack of a better word). So, in all fairness, I fee confident that I speak of things I know about first hand.

                <p>There is a change coming in the next decade or less which will toss most of the cards up in the air. Energy is about to cheapen, by about a factor of 20. This will de-power the oil nations, em-power the technologically inventive,
                  virtually eliminate pollution and poverty as we know it, and (Hurrah!) put paid to the AGW nonsense and the worse nonsense proposed to combat it.

                  The vehicle is pulsed plasma fusion; funding for a final research push to reach and surpass 'unity' in the next year or so is in hand, and subsequent engineering will result in a prototype and licensable design for manufacture of
                  small, 5GW-output generators world-wide. They will be waste-free, and require only a few days servicing once or twice a year.

                <p>Sorry Brian, I like Lerner, but his technique, I guess, will go th way of Bogdan Maglich's Migma, which was touted by CNN some 25 years ago. Similar quick jumps to fusion have been tried, and very recently, there was reported a
                  concepted where MIT (if I remember right) was looking into micro-scale fusion. Something that could power a laptop(?)

                  <br>
                  My pessimism has been correct so far, maybe Robert Bussards group at Polywell will succeed. My best guess is that fission, or unconventional natural gas, or even solar power sats, have a technical leg-up over fusion--even the

                  nano-scale "exploitation" of plasma instability in Focus Fusion. Repetitive small events that extinguish themselves with a burst of usable ion current and X-ray emission are vastly easier to initiate, manage, and sustain.

                <p>Brian,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As Spud points, out wild-eyed optimism about the ultimate success of this project is a triumph of hope over experience.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  But let us be technically optimistic for a moment. Could you walk us through exactly how this accomplishment would make for the materially better world you envision? Oil is used to power the fleet, so a better way to generate
                  electricity has no impact on oil dependence. Although this method might be better than, say pebble bed reactors, it would only be marginally better.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  My point is that while this would be a wonderful technological break-through, it would have little impact, because economics would be only marginally impacted. All the wonderful things you suppose would spring from this new
                  technology could spring from current technology. It doesn't so spring forth because 'social technology' is terribly flawed.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  That is a basic truth that is, for the most part, lost on the Mind-X community. In order to have a more perfect world, you must first have a more perfect intellectual infrastructure. That is what I was saying a year ago in the post
                  above titled 'The Rise and Fall' to which you replied. The 'social technology' has turned incomparably worse in this last tumultuous year.
                  <br>
                </p>

                <p>Brian,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As Spud points, out wild-eyed optimism about the ultimate success of this project is a triumph of hope over experience.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  But let us be technically optimistic for a moment. Could you walk us through exactly how this accomplishment would make for the materially better world you envision? Oil is used to power the fleet, so a better way to generate
                  electricity has no impact on oil dependence. Although this method might be better than, say pebble bed reactors, it would only be marginally better.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  //
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If you wade your way through the details, there is quite a bit more than "hope" involved. Here is a quicky summary of the immediate future at LPP/FFS:
                  <br>
                  "[the] scientific feasibility and validation phase and complete validation of technological feasibility by carrying out engineering studies and component testing of the three critical engineering challenges of Focus
                  Fusion'cooling, X-ray energy conversion and ion beam conversion. Cooling is critical to high-output functioning of the DPF, as there will be an unavoidable minimum of waste heat generated by electrical resistance, X-ray
                  absorption and contact with the hot plasma. This cooling will be particularly critical for the small anode at the center of the device. A very high efficiency compressed helium cooling system will be designed, and key components
                  will be fabricated in this phase of the project. Second, the ion beam converter will be designed, and key components such as the helical coils will be tested in our testing facility. Third, the multi-layered X-ray conversion system
                  will be designed and tested with the X-ray output from the DPF, allowing scaling up to the full several-thousand-layer converters.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  LPP will carry out the technological feasibility phase of the project in a 24-month period, overlapping by 12 months with the 24-month scientific feasibly experiment, which is expected to run through December 2010. A full-time
                  experienced engineer will be working on each engineering challenge, and a fourth engineer will act to integrate the work and interface with the scientific staff. In the second 12 months of the engineering feasibility phase
                  (essentially calendar 2011), the DPF facility will be mainly devoted to testing the components and modification of the DPF function for overall system optimization. The goal of the engineering phase is the demonstration that the
                  engineering goals required for Focus Fusion functioning are attainable."
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In the medium run, power is power, and inexpensive electricity can substitute for many or most uses of hydrocarbons. Generating plants would be the first to be replaced, but at the consumer level, heating fuel would be rather
                  quickly replaced with electric heat. BEVs and battery tech is advancing explosively, spearheaded by TeslaMotors and others, and the economics are already compelling; power cost reductions of 90% or more would amplify the
                  switchover.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As far as sea transport of oil goes, as demand falls, only the most efficient carriers will survive. Further, a compact (2-ton) 5MW generator can rather readily be adapted to drive a ship with electric motors. And many other large
                  vehicles.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Everything from metals refining to waste disposal or water purification can be dealt with far more cheaply. The magnitude of the cost differential is sufficient, I believe, to overcome the social barriers. The primary mechanism for
                  this will be "competitive advantage". Late adopters would find themselves at severe economic dis-advantage competing with early-adopter jurisdictions or firms. This would extend to the national and international level. Consider if
                  China's labor-cost advantage were augmented by a 10-20:1 power cost advantage. </p>

                  Capital Cost per Watt should be ~$0.05, versus $1+ for all current best generating tech, and $3+ for fission-nuclear.
                  <br>
                  Output, cost of generation, FOB generating station, should be ~0.25'/kwh ($0.0025).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Both are around 1/20 of best current commercial alternatives, and of course even lower compared to "green" and "renewable" proposals.

                <p>&gt;I wouldn't argue with the main idea of the article: The US can expect to be #1 economically for some time to come.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;But I would point out what Fareed Zakaria has pointed out: 1. We have a dysfunctional political system more interested in scoring points as a Democrat or Republican than in doing serious work to create change in the 'rules'
                  that would keep us competitive.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True. Both parties must go.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;We have the 2nd highest tax structure in the world.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Corporate taxes. True.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;2. Medicaid, Medicare and SS are threatening to bankrupt us.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;3. We have known since the 70's that we had 'energy' issues and Washington has done nothing, nada, to solve these and we are in a war because of it.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True.

                  <br>
                  &gt;We have no nuclear power program, we aren't building enough refineries, we don't drill enough off our own shores (ala Brazil),
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We should not drill off-shore because this may lower the price of gasoline. We need to keep the price of gasoline as high as absolutely possible until the MORONS in this country realize they need to CRASH and BURN their internal
                  combustion PigMobiles and move onto electric and flex-fuel cars.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;we've been suckered by the agricultural industry into using food stuff to create ethanol and our big three auto manufacturers seem to need a 2x4 right between the eyes to see what's right in front of their noses.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True to some extent, but you need to read the Zubrin strategy in ENERGY VICTORY.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;We need a radical overhaul of our medical system - NOT a government takeover but an infusion of freedom into a fascistic system that drives prices through the stratosphere.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Probably true. Corporate fascism is running rampant in this sector. Gov medical sys would probably be disaster. Greedy insurance companies, hospitals and insane trial lawyers in the system need to be reigned in and SUED into
                  bankruptcy. Doctors need to get back to practicing medicine. Lawyers/insurance companies need to STOP practicing medicine.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;There is much to be done if we don't want to find ourselves with an impoverished life style much less staying #1.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  True. I might add, we need to get back to a REPUBLICAN form of government. This means no more foreign wars and adventurism. The RIDICULOUS military we support all over the planet MUST be down-sized. 700 bases in 140 countries at
                  over $550 billion a year. Insane, insane, insane.... We need to get rid of all these social programs. The gov should PROTECT not PROVIDE. Only fight just wars, i.e., wars of defense ONLY.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Most of all, need to FLUSH out Congress and apply the Constitution.

                  <br>
                  You can thanks the media and TV networks for this polarization. To them the cock-fight between the Dems and GOP is nothing more than a 21st Century gladiator contest which they exploit for ratings. Apply some Sherman anti-Trust law
                  to the media and break them up and you will see much of this nonsense dissolve.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;We have the 2nd highest tax structure in the world.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  That's by design. We also have the largest DEDUCTION system. High taxes but high potential for deductions. The system is designed so the deductions can be handed out by gov to special interests like candy (when you are favored for
                  increasing the size of gov) or the complexity of the tax code can be used to "follow the money" and audit you (when you are NOT favored by the current party in power). There is NO other reason for the insane U.S. tax code than
                  these things.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;2. Medicaid, Medicare and SS are threatening to bankrupt us.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The use of FIAT money causes the toxic environment that increasingly atrophied businesses struggle to compete in. Thus the United States MUST have a socialist system of Medicaid, Medicare and SS simply in order for its citizens to
                  survive. If the citizens don't survive, the government can't milk them for taxes, debt service and insurance premiums -- thus the entire monolith crashes more quickly than it inevitably will when the fiat Ponzi has run its course
                  globally. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.fiatempire.org/" target="_blank">http://www.FiatEmpire.org</a> if you don't know what fiat money is.

                  &gt;3. We have known since the 70's that we had 'energy' issues and Washington has done nothing, nada, to solve these
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It's not Washington's responsibility to solve these. What are we Communist China? In a free-enterprise capitalist society, which is what the U.S. is supposed to be, it's up to entrepreneurs, as Jack Welch discusses, to "solve"
                  these issues. But the reason they can't and haven't is because BIG gov has it's nose all over the place granting special favors to this company and regulation on that company and taxing this and that. In short, socialists and
                  Marxists in the U.S. government have destroyed the entrepreneurial environment Jack Welch embarrassingly reminisces about in his old age.

                  Well, duh, war is the health of state. Put the dots together dude.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Because the GASOLINE industry (i.e., the Seven Sisters as distinct from OPEC, i.e., the OIL industry) doesn't WANT to build any more refineries. Read a book called THE TYRANNY OF OIL to better understand how the US GASOLINE
                  companies are exploiting their last days of transportation supremacy.

                  <br>
                  Oil and fossil fuels are DEAD. Get over it. We don't need to drill any more, we need to arrest the people that are suppressing COLD FUSION technology.

                  <br>
                  Robert Zubrin has completely explicated the bio-fuel industry and all the straw arguments involved with ETHANOL. Obviously an ETHANOL-based industry is and never was viable, but an ETHANOL + METHANOL + GASOLINE industry IS viable
                  enough to break the stranglehold OPEC has over the U.S. on RAW oil prices. Get up to speed on this by reading ENERGY VICTORY by Zubrin. BTW, this subject was already exhaustively explicated here at the MIND-X about two years ago.

                  <br>
                  And what's that? They need to be let go, this is what's right in front of them. Just like AGI and all the banks need to be let go. That's known as free-market capitalism.
                  <br>
                  &gt;We need a radical overhaul of our medical system - NOT a government takeover but an infusion of freedom into a fascistic system that drives prices through the stratosphere.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The problem with the health "care" industry is the GAME that's played between PROVIDERS and INSURANCE. Providers (hospitals and MDs) over-charge because they know multi-billion dollar insurance companies will pay. Multi-billion
                  dollar insurance companies never pay the full amount, they pay half or less. Thus the hospitals and doctors DEDUCT the "loss" on their tax returns. Now we are back to the game played by the U.S. tax system discussed earlier.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &gt;There is much to be done if we don't want to find ourselves with an impoverished life style much less staying #1.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Compared to what Americans COULD have had by now, they are living in poverty. But they deserve to be as they have allowed themselves and their representatives to wander from the US Constitution and the practice of free-enterprise
                  capitalism. I thus have no sympathy, but instead a recommendation: watch ORIGINAL INTENT at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.originalintent.us/" target="_blank">http://www.OriginalIntent.us</a> and FIAT
                  EMPIRE at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.fiatempire.org/" target="_blank">http://www.FiatEmpire.org</a> as these two films will explain what's going on. At the ORIGINAL INTENT site there will be an
                  extensive list of books and free internet movies that the citizen MUST read and watch unless they desire to remain clueless and impoverished.

                <p>I would agree with your assessment and add that, after hearing where school borads are heading in the heartland of America, we will be an economic power of widgit sellers and nothing more. A culture of fundementalist christians,
                  who love business and loath and mistrust science.The christian version of the Taliban is slowly applying its agenda little by little. They know that if they can influence the children, they most likely have them for life.
                  <br>
                  this is not the only threat. Americans are so parinoid that the rest of the world wants to kill them that the government will spend all it's resources on military empowerment to the detrement of the citizens it is trying to
                  protect. the result will be the same as when the the USSR fell. The USSR could not keep up with the west in military technological advantage and money spent. The Chinese will not have to lift a finger, merely watch as our own
                  dogmas and fears destroy us, and they will lend us the money to do it in the process.</p>

                <p>News flash, Jack - megabucks CEO's don't get us to Mars, or design highly efficient photovoltaic cells; engineers do. China may not be producing self-proclaimed gurus with publicists, agents, multiple luxury homes, and corporate
                  jets at their disposal 24/7. But China is cranking out several times as many engineers as the U.S every year. We even help educate some of them in our graduate schools. Through what's become a global knowledge network, Chinese
                  engineers and other professionals have access to every bit of our know-how that isn't Top Secret (and they can probably get to some of that as well.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We need both creative entrepeneurs and engineers, and our supply of both depends on a robust education system. But business interests across this nation are starving our public school system. My district, San Antonio ISD, includes
                  in its tax base most of the downtown business district. Those businesses are not required to disclose real estate sale or lease prices, and the county appraisal office is underfunded and understaffed. Any attempt to assess property
                  taxes at full value is met by a lawsuit filed by a top law firm. The chief appraiser's best estimate is that our business tax base is valued at about 60% of fair market value. Companies that own those businesses are in effect
                  stealing from the poorest children in the city.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Jack, you've moved beyond the "blame the teacher" approach to saying that creative greed can compensate for a struggling public school system that is being systematically choked off by conservative and business interests. For that
                  audience, you bring a welcome message.

                <p>We need both creative entrepeneurs and engineers, and our supply of both depends on a robust education system. But business interests across this nation are starving our public school system. My district, San Antonio ISD, includes
                  in its tax base most of the downtown business district.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  What absolute rubbish! The problem with public education is lack of funds? That is a red herring that keeps the whole damned enterprise grinding forward and grinding up our children. We need to totally get rid of government schools
                  - its the only way to save our children and give them a shot at education. How much empirical data does it take to wake up the public to the joke of 'public' education?</p>

                  The society that embraces evidence-based decision making and public policy will always prevail over one based on blind ideology. In the 50's and 60's the Chinese were the backwards ideologues and we were the industrial,
                  technological, and intellectual giants. That seems to be changing. If our articulate morons ever regain power, I fear we will switch places with the Chinese.</p>

                  the author clearly treats the behaviour of individuals as exogenous to his model. fact is, that exactly this entrepreneurial spirit is constantly attacked by collectivist and egalitarian mainstream thinking. entrepreneurs whose
                  profits are expropriated to an ever increasing extent in favour of equality will cease to be entrepreneurs. we are living in an age of social justice and you can have either euality or freedom. this will be the biggest threat to

                  Well gee-whiz genius, I would have thought that seeing the top marginal tax rate going from 90% in the 60s to its current rate would be expropriating to an ever DECREASING extent. Everyone here who is whining about Medicare or
                  higher taxes clearly didn't live through the Communism that was America's New Deal or Great Society. I didn't either but I know how to crack a history book.

                  <br>
                  As for China and India's "engineers", the vast majority of them are from second and third-tier schools in their home country who wouldn't come close to accreditation in America. If that number is adjusted to the number of engineers
                  that could qualify as such in America we still hold the lead.

                <p>&gt;Well gee-whiz genius, I would have thought that seeing the top marginal tax rate going from 90% in the 60s to its current rate would be expropriating to an ever DECREASING extent.

                <p>Our economy is five times as large as China's and 15 times larger than India's, with about one-fourth the population of either nation. That gives the U.S. a real advantage in providing education, health care, and

                  Our economy may be 5x China's but not in PPP where it is in fact less than 2x larger than China's... and that is what is important! With growth rates almost triple ours, China will surpass us in PPP within the first third of this

                <p>(1) Tax rates. The overwhelming factor affecting the growth of stable nations is tax rates. This, obviously, determines the basic picture of the world: the blazing hot economies are of course Hong Kong, Monaco, Dubai, etc.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The USA has now joined Western Europe as being a "grandpa" economy: the USA has staggeringly high, crushing taxes.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Whereas (somewhat oddly) tax in China is - in effect - extremely low. (This is of course ironic given that China was a communist state and the USA was once a capitalist beacon.) Doing real business, on the ground, in China, means
                  suffering almost no taxes to speak of in practice.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Similarly in India, taxes are (in effect) extremely low compared to the staggering burden in the USA. (Taxes are even lower in China than in India: and - of course - this is indeed the specific very simple reason that China is
                  doing "even better" than India for now.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (2) Regulations. Exactly the same applies to regulations. It's worth noting that the very reason the USA, in the past, would generally exceed Europe in growth was lack of regulation compared to "stuffy-old" Europe. Now, the USA is
                  indeed WORSE than Europe - the USA is a nightmare of regulation for business, or for getting anything done.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (A simple, and enormous, example is that New York used to be a world financial center. Now of course London is the world financial center as New York fades. The simple reason is: regulations. The world's money has not moved to
                  London for the weather.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (3) Environmentalism. Everything grows from epistemology. In the West and particularly in the USA, the religion of environmentalism completely controls almost all minds from bottom to top. Environmentalism is the latest version of
                  socialism - communism failed, socialism failed, so now we have environmentalism.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Environmentalism is, very simply, a "death" cult: that is, an "anti-life" force - in other words, anti-growth. Very simply, in three words: environmentalism despises growth. Hence, obviously, any region where almost everyone is a
                  devotee of the environmentalist religion ... will struggle to grow.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  it's simple: environmentalism hates growth, therefor environmentalist nations will not grow.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In contrast, people in China and India adore Life -- they love and adore growth. (Although - unfortunately for China - the Chinese leadership currently pays some lip service to the environmentalist religion, in a strategic ploy to
                  get along with the West.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (A funny example of this closer to home for Europeans is Russia: Russians despise environmentalism and think it is simply bonkers. Russia pays no lip service at all to environmentalism and simply laughs as Europe falls behind
                  Russia in energy issues, because Europe and environmentalism hate growth.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It's not complicated: in the USA, almost everyone - ie, environmentalists, simply despise power plants for example.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, again obviously, power plants are largely not being built in the USA. In contrast, the Chinese love and adore power and power plants, so, again obviously, power plants are being built at a spectacular rate in China.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (4) Mr. Welch odd ideas on engineers: anyone who has actually hired an engineer in the last 20 years will know that, bluntly: All the best engineers come from India, the second best engineers come from China, European (i.e.,
                  German) engineers are OK but slow, and the USA "doesn't have any" engineers.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (5) National entrepreneurial characteristics. Mr. Welch points out the clich' that the USA ("still") has "entrepreneurial" people who will take risks and do new different things. (Whereas, you know, those asians are mostly
                  good at copying stuff.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To some extent this is slightly true: "for now" it's culturally easier and more likely to invent the latest doowhicky (velcro surfer wallets, iPods, etc.) in the US than in China or India.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  BUT if you're going to go for "national characteristics" you have to go all the way:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Chinese are hard-working to a fault; Americans are the laziest people on the planet. Indian youth actually WANT TO get rich. (Just like American youth wanted to get rich any time up to say the 1950s.) In contrast, American youth of
                  today live in a cesspool defined by slackerism, reality TV, the most pathetic sort of celebrity worship, a desire for instant no-work "riches," and what can only be called general illiteracy.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Indeed, Mr. Welch's comment about "bright, hungry entrepreneurs" in the USA, unfortunately just reminds us Mr. Welch is old: tragically that WAS ONCE very true about the USA. However, five minutes in New Delhi completely redefines
                  "bright and hungry."
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (6) The obvious reality in front of our eyes. The simple fact is China (and indeed India) -- and indeed other parts of the "new world economy" are: simply smoking the USA.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Glance at the staggering 160-story Burj Dubai building, and glance at the forest of massive skyscrapers going up in China and Asia generally -- is the USA even in the top ten list for skyscrapers any more?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Glance at the stunning bridges, dams, and other mind-boggling engineering accomplishments in China and the "new economies" -- and think about how the world once marvelled at US bridges and infrastructure -- a long time ago.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Glance at - pick a random example - the world steel industry; which is of course completely dominated by a brilliant Indian, a real-life "Hank Rearden" capitalist Hero. (Just as the Scots and Americans dominated the steel industry
                  and were "capitalist Heros" -- back in the 1800s).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (7) National "stability"? The USA suffered Hurricane Katrina -- the government and social response was farsical and disastrous. China suffered the recent earthquakes -- the government and social response is fully orderly and
                  successful. On the world stage: the USA is entangled in - everything. Via the "war on terror" the US throws away a tremendous amount of its wealth, all of its prestige, and many lives; in China the leadership quietly builds world
                  relationships that advance China.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The US political scene is far and away the most fractured, "broken" of any Western country. There is no socio-political harmony whatsoever, but rather a completely empty battle - full of hate - typified by political figures who are
                  absolutely abhorred by one or the half of the population. The politcial "engine" of the country has become the most staggering spender -- waster -- of public money ever seen on Earth. The fiat dollar currency of the US is in
                  crisis, of course many States and localities (and indeed - the Federal entity) are flirting with bankruptcy or low credit ratings.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This chaos results in symptoms on the ground from electricity shortages, infrastructure "insanities" like Boston's "big dig" (compare the simply achieved, extremely successful, and far more complex infrastructure projects in the
                  East), and crushingly overwhelming ever-proliferating bureaucracies and departments.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  To recap the various issues raised by Mr Welch, simply looking at facts:

                  Tax is spectacularly worse in the US than in India or China, which are effectively laissez faire tax havens in comparision. Regulation is of course staggeringly problematic in the US, and getting worse by the month.
                  Environmentalism - very simply, "hatred of growth" - is the primary religion of almost all people in the USA; in contrast Chinese and Indians love and want growth. Mr Welch specifically mentions "engineering" as a US strength,
                  which is (tragically) spectacularly incorrect for at least 20 years. Regarding the "national characteristics" issue: Indians are tremendously hard-working, Chinese are desperate to be rich, and USA residents are today, in a word,
                  lazy. (Particularly, the "total loss" in our era of young people in the USA to celebrityism, vulgarity, and illiteracy is a tragedy.) And the US socio-political picture can only be described as "disastrous:" spending out of control
                  in a way never before seen by any nation in 3000 years of history, spectacular layers of bureaucracy (growing spectacularly), astonishing social disharmony.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Mr. Welch is a great man who grew one of the greatest of companies. I feel his comments, very simply, are "in the past." his positive observations about the US were very much true - say, in the 1950s.

                  it is arguably more impt than anything, even the malthusian orgy of peak oil
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  as a symptom, a metric, of health, if nothing else

                  <br>
                  if u can extract what you need from this gossamer fragile ecosystem and leave it intact, that is the sign of true, sustainable engr actualization
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  and tho i hear screams of bloody murder here, you know guys, its not really that hard
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  it may cost a tad more - maybe, it depends - but, the benefit of preserving the integrity of the environment there
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  of course, with a sensible ecological value analysis for whatever is the project locale
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  ive studied and pondered this a long time, its not really that holy cow final destination or something, there are almost always far better env impact approaches that as often as not cost no more
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  just, no one was thinking abt the env, at all
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  i think an env impact study for just abt any project or zoning change makes sense
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  knowledge really does rule the world, but one must be interested in the questions that have that knowledge as their answer

  <br>
  of course, the main benefit: it can give forever, sustainably
  <br>
  <br>
  dont think 10 yrs, think 1,000, as a starting point
  <br>
  <br>
  almost none of our industrial practices are sustainable on a timeline of even that tiny scope, 1000 yrs
  <br>
  <br>
  peak oil is just one of every practice that is not sustainable
  <br>
  <br>
  but, there are always smarter ways to do things
  <br>
  <br>
  - farm fish, so u dont have to scrape the ocean bottom, destroying everything living there
  <br>
  <br>
  - farm trees, so you dont have to clearcut virgin forests, that often have high concentrations of species diversity
  <br>
  <br>
  these require effort, yes
  <br>
  <br>
  new ways of thinking? not really, but a smidge i guess
  <br>
  <br>
  its just doing it in such a way, that u can keep doing it that way for 1,000 yrs
  <br>
  <br>
  or a million
  <br>
  <br>
  kind of a diff mindset, isnt it?

          lol, you can say that again

          they care more about growth than about their citizens, their environment, or anything else
          <br>
          <br>
          they will sacrifice everything for growth
          <br>
          <br>
          but theyre already hitting their limits, and amazingly, china is in similar shape to japan in terms of oldies, their 1 child policy has penetrated them anally in terms of their demographic future

        <p>&gt;(1) Tax rates. The overwhelming factor affecting the growth of stable nations is tax rates.
          <br>
          <br>
          And how much they spend on their military.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;This, obviously, determines the basic picture of the world: the blazing hot economies are of course Hong Kong, Monaco, Dubai, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          Dubai is more a function of petrol dollars than tax rates. Check out the website I put up to show dumb Americans where they petrodollars are going. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.mecfilms.com/universe/articles/dubai.htm"
            target="_blank">http://www.mecfilms.com/universe/articles/dubai.ht m</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The USA has now joined Western Europe as being a "grandpa" economy: the USA has staggeringly high, crushing taxes.
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Whereas (somewhat oddly) tax in China is - in effect - extremely low. (This is of course ironic given that China was a communist state and the USA was once a capitalist beacon.)
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Doing real business, on the ground, in China, means suffering almost no taxes to speak of in practice.
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Similarly in India, taxes are (in effect) extremely low compared to the staggering burden in the USA. (Taxes are even lower in China than in India: and - of course - this is indeed the specific very simple reason that China is doing
          "even better" than India for now.)
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(2) Regulations. Exactly the same applies to regulations. It's worth noting that the very reason the USA, in the past, would generally exceed Europe in growth was lack of regulation compared to "stuffy-old" Europe. Now, the USA is
          indeed WORSE than Europe - the USA is a nightmare of regulation for business, or for getting anything done.
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(A simple, and enormous, example is that New York used to be a world financial center. Now of course London is the world financial center as New York fades. The simple reason is: regulations. The world's money has not moved to London
          for the weather.)
          <br>
          <br>
          True, but we are just following World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(3) Environmentalism. Everything grows from epistemology.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. The master study.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;In the West and particularly in the USA, the religion of environmentalism completely controls almost all minds from bottom to top.
          <br>
          <br>
          No, mostly the Democrat "mind."
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Environmentalism is the latest version of socialism - communism failed, socialism failed, so now we have environmentalism.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some say.
          <br>

          &gt;Environmentalism is, very simply, a "death" cult: that is, an "anti-life" force - in other words, anti-growth. Very simply, in three words: environmentalism despises growth.
          <br>
          <br>
          No it doesn't. It just despises growth that damages or exterminates the biosphere. The actual cult here in the US is the cult of CONSUMERISM. I call it the MONEY MENTALITY.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Hence, obviously, any region where almost everyone is a devotee of the environmentalist religion ... will struggle to grow.
          <br>
          <br>
          I realize that environmentalism is as dangerous as globalism because both have the potential to be used to garner domination over the masses. The thing that makes environmentalism different is the fact that we can't experiment with the
          biosphere because if we cause a phase transition, we could knock out the equilibrium of the system causing an extinction-level event. Can't FUCK with this sir.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;it's simple: environmentalism hates growth, therefore environmentalist nations will not grow.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's a mindless and overly general summary.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;In contrast, people in China and India adore Life -- they love and adore growth.
          <br>
          <br>
          Multinational corporate "growth" and "Life are hardly the same things. Please. What we have in the US is UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM also known as MONOPOLISTIC CAPITALISM. Capitalism -- in a FREE MARKET environment, where there is NO government
          regulation AND the corporations do NOT ask for or receive ANY privileges -- works better than any other known system. That said, the best economic system PROBABLY hasn't yet been invented, yet.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(Although - unfortunately for China - the Chinese leadership currently pays some lip service to the environmentalist religion, in a strategic ploy to get along with the West.)
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(A funny example of this closer to home for Europeans is Russia: Russians despise environmentalism and think it is simply bonkers.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's because they can't afford to do much else. Their entire "economic" system collapsed, remember?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Russia pays no lip service at all to environmentalism and simply laughs as Europe falls behind Russia in energy issues, because Europe and environmentalism hate growth.)
          <br>
          <br>
          This is a straw argument. Environmentalists want growth from solar, wind, hydro, fusion geo thermal -- all clean energy system that mean renewed life to the planet AND industry. The MONEY MENTALITY wants growth from coal, oil, natural gas,
          nuclear waste -- all energy systems that mean DEATH to the planet.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;It's not complicated: in the USA, almost everyone - i.e., environmentalists, simply despise power plants for example.
          <br>
          <br>
          No, they despise DIRTY, rotting, filthy, carbon dioxide-spewing power plants that are turning the planet into a WASTELAND. In other words: if the Fossil Fuel Establishment has not yet amortized their $12 trillion infrastructure by now:
          they can get fucked.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;So, again obviously, power plants are largely not being built in the USA.
          <br>
          <br>
          You are right in part to be angry about this because we SHOULD have been building solar, pebble bed nuclear, FUSION, geothermal and possibly sequestered coal plants all along but that ABORTION we call "congress" has been in the PAY of the
          Status Quo Energy Establishment for decades and they have CUT budgets to clean energy, and FUNDED the $550 billion per year military Establishment to protect the SAUDI ARABIAN KINGDOM so that we can get CHEAP under-world market priced oil
          to keep the Auto and Energy Establishment MAKING MONEY.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;In contrast, the Chinese love and adore power and power plants, so, again obviously, power plants are being built at a spectacular rate in China.
          <br>
          <br>
          Mostly dirty coal plants and some pebble bed reactors.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(4) Mr. Welch odd ideas on engineers: anyone who has actually hired an engineer in the last 20 years will know that, bluntly: All the best engineers come from India, the second best engineers come from China, European (i.e., German)
          engineers are OK but slow, and the USA "doesn't have any" engineers.
          <br>
          <br>
          False. These places standards are much lower than the US. That said, the US education system DOES suck and HAS been corporatized by the plutocracy that dominates the US gov.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(5) National entrepreneurial characteristics. Mr. Welch points out the clich' that the USA ("still") has "entrepreneurial" people who will take risks and do new different things.
          <br>
          <br>
          Most investors in the US are scared little weenies.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(Whereas, you know, those asians are mostly good at copying stuff.)
          <br>
          <br>
          Don't know.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;To some extent this is slightly true: "for now" it's culturally easier and more likely to invent the latest doowhicky (velcro surfer wallets, iPods, etc.) in the US than in China or India.
          <br>
          <br>
          BUT if you're going to go for "national characteristics" you have to go all the way:
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Chinese are hard-working to a fault;
          <br>
          <br>
          Chinese workers are slaves. They work hard of they get the whip.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Americans are the laziest people on the planet.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes, American workers in general are fat, lazy and stupid, but NAFTA and GATT has made them that way because they have become APATHETIC due to the fact that the WTO playing field is not level and the plutocracy has taken over the gov and
          the Benedict Arnold CEOs are running rampant all over the planet.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Indian youth actually WANT TO get rich. (Just like American youth wanted to get rich any time up to say the 1950s.) In contrast, American youth of today live in a cesspool defined by slackerism, reality TV, the most pathetic sort of
          celebrity worship, a desire for instant no-work "riches," and what can only be called general illiteracy.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. But apathy has caused them to be this way. The sick, drug-ridden, sex-crazed BabyBoomers have ruined the United States. They are the Worst Generation.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Indeed, Mr. Welch's comment about "bright, hungry entrepreneurs" in the USA, unfortunately just reminds us Mr. Welch is old: tragically that WAS ONCE very true about the USA. However, five minutes in New Delhi completely redefines
          "bright and hungry."
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(6) The obvious reality in front of our eyes. The simple fact is China (and indeed India) -- and indeed other parts of the "new world economy" are: simply smoking the USA.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Glance at the staggering 160-story Burj Dubai building, and glance at the forest of massive skyscrapers going up in China and Asia generally -- is the USA even in the top ten list for skyscrapers any more?
          <br>
          <br>
          No. Pathetic but true.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Glance at the stunning bridges, dams, and other mind-boggling engineering accomplishments in China and the "new economies" -- and think about how the world once marvelled at US bridges and infrastructure -- a long time ago.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. You can thank Congress and the Globalists that have hijacked the US. You can thank Cultural Marxism as well. Thank the multinationals that have gone traitor on America.
          <br>
          Where is the guillotine when we need it?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Glance at - pick a random example - the world steel industry; which is of course completely dominated by a brilliant Indian, a real-life "Hank Rearden" capitalist Hero. (Just as the Scots and Americans dominated the steel industry and
          were "capitalist Heros" -- back in the 1800s).
          <br>
          <br>
          The plutocrats have destroyed the middle class.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;(7) National "stability"? The USA suffered Hurricane Katrina -- the government and social response was farsical and disastrous. China suffered the recent earthquakes -- the government and social response is fully orderly and
          successful.
          <br>
          <br>
          One word: BUSH.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;On the world stage: the USA is entangled in - everything. Via the "war on terror" the US throws away a tremendous amount of its wealth, all of its prestige, and many lives; in China the leadership quietly builds world relationships
          that advance China.
          <br>
          <br>
          The CFR and DAVOS crowd are purposely trying to neuter the United States so it will more comfortably "integrate" into the world institutions they have prepared. In this New World Order you can't have any uncontrolled 20 ton pink gorillas
          in the living room.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The US political scene is far and away the most fractured, "broken" of any Western country.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's because the Congress has been hijacked by corporate interests and there are no term limits.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; There is no socio-political harmony whatsoever, but rather a completely empty battle - full of hate - typified by political figures who are absolutely abhorred by one or the half of the population.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is cultural Marxism at work.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The politcial "engine" of the country has become the most staggering spender -- waster -- of public money ever seen on Earth. The fiat dollar currency of the US is in crisis, of course many States and localities (and indeed - the
          Federal entity) are flirting with bankruptcy or low credit ratings.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank the criminals that put through the Federal Reserve System, the engine of all this political and economic debauchery. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.fiatempire.com/" target="_blank">http://www.FiatEmpire.com</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;This chaos results in symptoms on the ground from electricity shortages, infrastructure "insanities" like Boston's "big dig" (compare the simply achieved, extremely successful, and far more complex infrastructure projects in the East),
          and crushingly overwhelming ever-proliferating bureaucracies and departments.
          <br>
          <br>
          Too much money spent on the military too little spent on infrastructure.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;To recap the various issues raised by Mr Welch, simply looking at facts:
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Tax is spectacularly worse in the US than in India or China, which are effectively laissez faire tax havens in comparision.
          <br>
          <br>
          WTO rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Regulation is of course staggeringly problematic in the US, and getting worse by the month.
          <br>
          <br>
          WTO rules.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Environmentalism - very simply, "hatred of growth" - is the primary religion of almost all people in the USA; in contrast Chinese and Indians love and want growth.
          <br>
          <br>
          And filthy and carbon dioxide.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Mr Welch specifically mentions "engineering" as a US strength, which is (tragically) spectacularly incorrect for at least 20 years.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Regarding the "national characteristics" issue: Indians are tremendously hard-working, Chinese are desperate to be rich, and USA residents are today, in a word, lazy. (Particularly, the "total loss" in our era of young people in the
          USA to celebrityism, vulgarity, and illiteracy is a tragedy.)
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank the liberal, not-very-religious Jewish males of European heritage that dominate the MPAA studio/distributors. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM/bginfo.htm" target="_blank">http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM/bginfo.htm</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;And the US socio-political picture can only be described as "disastrous:" spending out of control in a way never before seen by any nation in 3000 years of history,
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank:
          <br>
          <br>
          A. Fiat money;
          <br>
          B. Fractional reserve banking.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;spectacular layers of bureaucracy (growing spectacularly), astonishing social disharmony.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank:
          <br>
          <br>
          A. Failure to KNOW the Constitution;
          <br>
          B. Failure to APPLY the Constitution.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Mr. Welch is a great man who grew one of the greatest of companies. I feel his comments, very simply, are "in the past."
          <br>
          <br>
          Mostly true.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;his positive observations about the US were very much true - say, in the 1950s.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.

        <p>The Marxists posting on this thread may disdain American capitalism and American politics, but they should remember a few facts:
          <br>
          <br>
          1. American capitalism is by far the most productive and creative in the world. Check any list of comparative GDPs.
          <br>
          <br>
          2. American capitalism has been so since 1870 (5 years after the bloody and destructive Civil War!) when it officially surpassed Great Britain, a sure sign of long-term durability and competitive zest.
          <br>
          <br>
          3. American capitalism is legalized and protected by a proven, long-term, stable, durable Democratic Republic, better known as the United States of America. India and China should wish for such competence.
          <br>
          <br>
          4. America is by far the LEAST polluting of ANY of the great industrialized countries in the world. Read the recent Smithsonian magazine's horror story about the Ganges River for disgusting details on genuine pollution.
          <br>
          <br>
          5. American culture truly values entrepreneurial inventiveness on the part of INDIVIDUALS. Ask the Marxists on this thread how much they value individualism. Not much, I'd wager.
          <br>
          <br>
          And now, to make a point that may only seem to you to be off topic. IF (and I mean IF) China and India, the EU and Brazil, and any other contenders begin to approach American economic mastery, WILL it be too late for them, in terms of
          geopolitical balance of power concerns...IF the Singularity is also approaching, and perhaps happens?
          <br>
          <br>
          I'll answer my own question with Ray Kurzweil's own prognostications: According to his analysis of Moore's Law and other trends, the Singularity is due sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. There is no way in Aitch Eeee Double Hockey Sticks that
          ANY nation could make a serious move on the American lead in that comparatively short amount of time.
          <br>
          <br>
          In short, Welch is right, but for reasons that he wasn't aware of. The Singularity's coming on stronger than China and India.

          When nanotech can use all molecules from dead leaves, old socks, urine, feces, and all and any production effluent, all worries about pollution will be as has-been as your Marxian anti-Americanism.
          <br>
          <br>
          Who would ever bother throwing their highly useful molecules into the atmosphere, the river, the ocean or the landfill ever again when their home nano vat sits there needing refills?

        <p>I stumbled upon Welch's essay when checking Kurzweil's site. It interested me. And I felt I had to respond to the ill-thought-out Marxists' responses to it. No moderator contacted me for comment.
          <br>
          <br>
          How many people on this thread actually read "The Singularity is Near" and Drexler's work on nanotechnology? How many thought through the startling implications on our lives? If they did, how could they bring such inane 19th century
          Marxist analysis to a very clearly 21st century advanced technology topic?
          <br>
          <br>
          How could they miss the fact that the self-organizing nature of American civilization meshes far better with accelerating change (actually spurs it on in many cases)in comparison to status quo environmentalism, outdated Marxist class

              <br>
              The Marxists posting on this thread may disdain American capitalism and American politics, but they should remember a few facts:
              <br>
              <br>
              1. American capitalism is by far the most productive and creative in the world. Check any list of comparative GDPs.
              <br>
              <br>
              2. American capitalism has been so since 1870 (5 years after the bloody and destructive Civil War!) when it officially surpassed Great Britain, a sure sign of long-term durability and competitive zest.
              <br>
              <br>
              3. American capitalism is legalized and protected by a proven, long-term, stable, durable Democratic Republic, better known as the United States of America. India and China should wish for such competence.
              <br>
              <br>
              4. America is by far the LEAST polluting of ANY of the great industrialized countries in the world. Read the recent Smithsonian magazine's horror story about the Ganges River for disgusting details on genuine pollution.
              <br>
              <br>
              5. American culture truly values entrepreneurial inventiveness on the part of INDIVIDUALS. Ask the Marxists on this thread how much they value individualism. Not much, I'd wager.
              <br>
              <br>
              And now, to make a point that may only seem to you to be off topic. IF (and I mean IF) China and India, the EU and Brazil, and any other contenders begin to approach American economic mastery, WILL it be too late for them, in terms of
              geopolitical balance of power concerns...IF the Singularity is also approaching, and perhaps happens?
              <br>
              <br>
              I'll answer my own question with Ray Kurzweil's own prognostications: According to his analysis of Moore's Law and other trends, the Singularity is due sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. There is no way in Aitch Eeee Double Hockey Sticks
              that ANY nation could make a serious move on the American lead in that comparatively short amount of time.
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, Welch is right, but for reasons that he wasn't aware of. The Singularity's coming on stronger than China and India.

          their children will have to live with the decisions I make, and the ones that you make. The ideals you seem to think are still alive in America are not here any more, and therefore, we are ALL in jeopardy. NO Empire last forever. Some are
          short lived and others undergo metamorphosis in order to keep the elite on top... The only constant is change. Why hate China or India? (It is evident in your fatherland undertones). Embrace them as mutual partners for progress in the
          right directions.

          <br>
          I'd like to point out a few facts first about Karl Marx:
          <br>
          <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          While I do not personally embrace communistic doctrine, I realize that the communism of today and the twisting of history have little to do with the tenets of Marxism. per se. Similarly, just as the Baptists are zealots and the Catholics
          are corrupt in ideology - each far and well removed from the original teachings of Jesus (for good example and balance) - so I say, is the modern communistic and Marxist dogma. If you read the link above and educated yourself a little, you
          would realize that there are many merits in his work and that the man was a brilliant and hard working man - hated because he railed against the rapidly dominating materialism based societies that were arising from unfettered and corrupted
          versions of capitalism. If you really want to know what capitalism is and where it comes from, read on:
          <br>
          <br>
          <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          While flawed in its own right, Marxism is not some evil in and of itself - it is an ideal for some, if only because it is counter to the extreme forms of capitalism that have caused a huge inequity in the world. Your liberal use of
          language in context is some evidence of your un-educated bias of all things intellectually stimulating - knowing both sides of the coin allow one to be balanced. THIS IS WHY I debate as I do - to counter the other extreme you have shown
          here - an extreme I see mainstream among those educated (= indoctrinated) in the current system of schools. It is readily apparent that you are thoroughly indoctrinated by the schools of Consumerism, and I must say it is obvious that you
          cannot but abhor anything counter to your programming.
          <br>
          <br>
          One could note that Karl Marx was greatly supported and funded by many so-called elite in the United States and that it was the USA corporations (names withheld) that backed the bloody revolution of the Bolsheviks in order to gain access
          to mining rights and other resources in Russia at the time. IT WAS CAPITALISM THAT GAVE COMMUNISM ITS BIRTH! Read a book other than the Agenda for A New American World Order, please. You might find out WHY EVERYONE mistrusts the government
          here - not you or I (The People), but the corrupt capitalist OWNERS of the former free Republic of America. I LOVE my country, yet I allow myself to THINK freely... this empowers me to contribute to THE PEOPLE, not the corporations.
          <br>
          <br>
          So, in summation, maybe only intellectuals can see all sides of the paradigm, Ma'am, and those self centered zealot prophets of evangelical, nationalistic capitalism cannot. They are through and through, products of system. Good for
          consumption and further propagation of like minded ilk. So that I am crystal clear on my perception of "it" - Capitalism itself is not evil, it is an advanced function of society, necessary to keep the interchange of commerce between
          entities flowing, however IT IS THE EASE by which the corrupt can take advantage of its flawed mechanism of organization and control that are dangerous! Note that there are indeed many forms of capitalism and the main thrust of MY argument
          is that the one here in the United States is critically flawed, biased in its service to the public good and obviously completely manipulated for gain by ONLY a select few at the detriment of The People at large - contrary to the ideals
          this country were founded on (FACT).

              inane 19th century Marxist analysis to a very clearly 21st century advanced technology topic? </p>
          </center>
          <br>
          Thought through the startling implications? This is hollow language. I can think through any fantasy I want, doesn't make it any more REAL. I have read and seen many things (including the above and deeper works on the subjects) and would
          caution against taking any ONE man's word for the future. NO ONE can predict the outcome of complex interactions, cause and effect that weave what we call the future. Yes, these technologies are being developed at a good clip, but there
          are factors OTHER that the technology itself, that make the eventual APPLICATION of that technology VIABLE. What you are asking us to do is look through a tube and ignore the peripheral reality of cause and effect. ECONOMICS and POLITICS
          have far more bearing on the eventual actualization of technology than the persons dreaming of and developing the technology do themselves! Here is a prime example: I know a group of engineers and assorted scientific leaders in their
          fields that have developed, ready for market, a satellite system capable of beaming energy directly to the Earth via laser beam at certain frequency. The technology is thoroughly trial tested and has been developed to a point where it can
          be used to power 4GW power plants in each array. You want to know the sad truth about American Capitalism and its so-called free market? They have to sell this power system to the Chinese because they are under threats (life and limb)
          against using this technology in America - the power kings here in the free market called America, control the APPLICATION of technology simply because profit and control is the MOST important thing - so, while you pay through the nose for
          energy and use polluting tech, keep in mind that AMERICAN capitalism PREVENTS the use of this technology! Whereas, in a "socialist" or "communist" capitalistic society, the demands of the people are first, not a few individuals.
          <br>
          <br>
          A small additional Off Topic caveat for you: Over "there", they execute people like Enron CEO's (GREAT POLICY!) and officials that are corrupt, WHEN that corruption costs the lives of the people or equally damaging. Hmmmm. All facts lady.

            <p class="mindxquote"> How could they miss the fact that the self-organizing nature of American civilization meshes far better with accelerating change (actually spurs it on in many cases)in comparison to status quo environmentalism,

          None of this makes any sense - it is more empty language driven by an emotional mind. The self-organizing nature of American civilization - a fact? WOW! Are you for real? Self-organizing - every one is, even Russia, even an amoeba - don't
          use this fools language here. This is dumb dumb language used by politicians to fill empty heads with empty words (no meaning). Nature of American civilization??? What IS THAT? First, there is no one culture or "civilization" in America -
          it is a hodge-podge of competing cultures, most of which mistrust and even openly despise each other in increasing fervor! All that we have today, has been held together by a strict Anglo-Saxon code of governance and has only remained
          "stable" BECAUSE of the ruling elite being homogeneous Anglo-Saxon in culture!! FACT, whether you like it or not, politically correct or not - IT IS REALITY. This is rapidly giving way to a cold civil war now that the "other" competing
          ideologies of differing cultures have wealth within their ranks - this is a NEW phenomena and not calculated, obviously, by your great sage, Welch. The very same MISTAKE of the Roman empire has been repeated. You CANNOT maintain a
          functional Republic without perpetuating a singular doctrine of belief that UNITES the multitude of differing cultures within your borders, usually in the form of a religion, a common enemy, a moral code, an education system (there are
          many ways) - Currently here in America - giving them (other cultures) free reign IS THE PROBLEM! THEY DO NOT HAVE the interests of the "other" Americans at heart or even America itself. Watch rallies lately?? Any one? "Tolerance" being the
          idiots catch word and the fools errand. Living in peace and freely vetted as an individual means keeping your culture and your ideology OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE and TO YOURSELF - Tolerance for these competing cultures is the destruction of an
          Empire. Individual freedom of PRIVATE expression is the key. Not my philosophy, just read history. Without LOGICAL and CALCULATED, SINGULAR precepts of governance and culture, all things WILL collapse upon themselves - PROVEN by endless
          volumes of world history. You, apparently are part of that experiment, whereas consumerism is the defining cultural playing field that all groups will interact on here in America. HA ha ha. This is the funniest thing ever, since great
          in-equality exists within the State and without - eventual rebellion will result. Especially soon when people can't buy food here... get it yet? American consumerism is a SICKNESS that infects the people with low intelligence, sloth, low
          self-esteem, short attention spans, un-disciplined behaviours and on and on and on - EVIDENCE? Watch the local news in (insert your home city). Obtuse if you think THIS works. It MAY APPEAR to work better than other systems, and it may
          indeed, which is a poor testament to mans achievements, but it is still DEEPLY flawed and destructive to man kind in general - it is amoral and wrought with every selfish vice known.
          <br>
          <br>
          How you compare this to other forms of governance is one thing, but keep this in mind - CONSUMERISM knows no nationality and neither do the corporations running this country!! The very same corporations that are training our kids in
          school, starting wars for profit and making you eat the sh*t food we find on the shelves of our "free" country. The "America" corporations care NOTHING or America or its People. Are you really that brainwashed? I'd suggest getting the
          McFAt burger out of your mouth for starters since it is scientifically proven to screw up your body, and therefore your mind. Courtesy of American capitalism. Poison food. Lead toys (YES - AMERICAN company, outsourcing in China - blame the
          Chinese though, right?). War machine. MINDLESS TV selling sh*t to American kids. GREAT system indeed. Better than a dictatorship? Of course. Better than a Socialist state where NO ONE goes hungry or dies from lack of medical care - or even
          a poor, backwards country where people live off the land? You be the judge. I think that here we must look at the GOOD in EACH system, whether Marxist or Capitalist and use the ELEMENTS that are beneficially in EACH and eliminate the
          destructive forces. You would rather we embrace the one-sided??

          <br>
          As to how any one CAN NOT disdain American politics is beyond me. American politics is the reason why the country is failing the grade (literally). The Founding Fathers (Masons I will add, not religious fools) did NOT envision a country
          run by political families, but by free men bound to public service when the NEED arose, not as a means of graft and lifestyle! It is SURELY UN-American, what is now called "American Politics". YOU should remember a few facts, like American

          <br>
          <br>
          Northern industry that controlled politics in the North wanted total control over the Southern production - the Southerners were selling and trading with England at much better terms than the Northern business men!! So, in order to destroy
          the South's ability to remain sovereign economically and to capture the production capability of the South for PURE PROFIT for ONLY THE Northern Business Men - they orchestrated the civil war. I can go on and give details, facts and
          figures (but I tire) including the fact that Abraham Lincoln himself, in a letter to his wife, admitted that the slavery issue was a ruse and that HE HIMSELF did not see the Black Man as equal to White! Wonder why the US Penny looks the
          way it does, head left, color dark??? Hero to WHOM? But in order to "unify" the country, the Slavery issue was brought to the forefront so that the English subjects would rise in popular opposition to the British military support of the
          South. The entire political premise was a fake out. On top of that, Abraham Lincoln and his puppeteers destroyed the sovereignty of the States and helped create the unbalanced power of the Federal government we have now in clear violation
          of the original intents of this country! Here is a definition of fascism for your info: "Various scholars attribute different characteristics to fascism, but the following elements are usually seen as its integral parts: patriotism,
          nationalism, statism, militarism, totalitarianism, anti-communism, economic planning (including corporatism and autarky), populism, collectivism, autocracy and anti-liberalism (i.e., opposition to political and economic liberalism)." Are

          the Dynasty, chasing out the foreigners that were exploiting the indigenous Chinese masses!! Who do you think the Taiwanese are?! Manchus. A situation where 10% ruled 90% and slaved them all in a highly capitalistic society, no less. The
          Mao revolution was not about communism, but about returning power to the people - the ideals of communism made it easier for Mao to unify under a single doctrine, that's all. America, on the other hand, is a child nation, newly birthed

          on a War Machine economy that sucks the life blood from its citizens, and where bankers steal and siphon the individual wealth of all free Americans of all creeds, races and positions in society. While I personally appreciate wealth and
          realize it as the right of anyone capable of developing their personal wealth - However, NOT on the BACKS of others without fair trade of value for labor received - which is the MAIN reason WHY so many super rich live in America. On the

          clothed, educated and content, just like us Americans here at home. Your language seems to reflect a position that America should be the only one entitled to power and position of prestige... We need to have a ONE world view in order for
          mankind to survive and prosper. The Singularity, if realized in the current political state of affairs will be a great tool of destruction and evil. The geo-political reality is that mostly selfish and self-serving men rule the earth today
          and any power of this magnitude should be kept far away from any nation, including the USA. Until the developers of this technology realize this and use this AI to seize power for themselves, I feel it prudent NOT to wish for Singularity
          and its predecessors. While human nature requires always an elite to rule and sell the ideals of civilization as they see it, I believe only a scientist elite would be best for mankind, not a political or corporate one (for now at least
          until the next "leap"). This will be the New Revolution, I hope. Power taken by those that create it in the first place. Not fat slovenly foxes seeking dominion and lust fulfillment. IMHO anyway.

        <p>One more thing on this before I let it drop :-)
          <br>
          <br>
          Read this article. There are countless other references I can provide from virtually EVERY country in the world. You will notice something peculiar: Chinese run and operate Mom and Pop business every where they immigrate to. China is
          kicking ASS this way. Do you not understand how this game is played? I told you that the Chinese are FAR more tactically educated and intellectually capable of playing an end game resource war than the West. The new world will be one large
          Anglo-Chinese "Nation" (maybe Chinese-Anglo) and "America" will be left for the poor masses from Latin America and the US Americans who couldn't afford to leave before it came crashing down. America is already almost stripped down to the
          bone economically and now we are selling off every asset we have from companies to name brands to Cities! Believe it. It is history.

        <p>You did? Interesting that you find Sally's points anything but the same regurgitated language used by many of like ilk. As for my use of language, it is for EMOTIONAL CONTENT, not emotion itself - kind of like "Bruce Lee" when he teaches
          "the kid" about striking for effect. So, where is the hypocrisy?
          <br>
          <br>
          As for getting worked up, it's necessary sometimes - perhaps if Americans would get worked up, the country wouldn't be in shambles. It is precisely this attitude that IS the problem. Sally's apparent doctrine at work is more in line with
          "Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui m'me!" - to quote Vincent de Gournay. The whole premise on which her essay was written is flawed from foundation to pinnacle, due in large part to the use of unrealistic premise's
          to substantiate her positions and points.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you do not understand the reference and misconstrue the point, then it is plain why you would find Sally's writing "compelling". Really? OK, if you say so.</p>

          - multi-ethnic and religious diversity isn't something you can "fix" it remains a constant source of conflict - always. There NEVER has been a time or place or empire or country where it has not been so -

          As is typical, engineers got better sense than find themselves mired in nonsense. Not that your not absolutely right, everybody's got to play the influence-game. So.. when do you expect humanity will get there? It's my thinking we're all

          off exports of food an other goods to US. What happens when Russia is the bread basket of the world? End game as we no longer have ANYTHING to offer ANYONE, except war.

          There may be shortages, but there won't be any starvation.

          <br>
          Exact statistics that lead to a statement such as 'California produces 75% of all food in America' or ''California produces 33% of all food in America' are a little misleading, because there are many ways to measure it (such as total lbs.
          of food, total revenue, total manufactured food products, etc.)
          <br>
          <br>
          I heard the 75% figure from someone who's really into keeping track of this sort of thing, and didn't think to question him or check the exact figures.
          <br>
          <br>
          But, as you might note from the above, and I know because I have lived here my entire life, California is NOT going to starve: we have soooooooooo much food here, and an enormous variety of it, which was my overarching point, regardless of
          statistics.
          <br>
          Point being, even if the economy collapses, there is food.
          <br>
          Yes, we might end up with soup lines and other horrible situations like that.....but people won't be dying of starvation.

          To consider the position of California relative to the food consumption of the rest of the United States
          <br>
          outside California and to the United States as a whole, we estimated the farm value of U.S. food
          <br>
          consumption and the farm value of U.S. food consumption outside California (RoUS). Total farm value
          <br>
          of U.S. food consumption at is about $140 billion, with about 12 percent ($16.8 billion) of that in
          <br>
          California. California production of food accounts for about 14.6 percent of total U.S. food consumption
          <br>
          ($20.5 billion California production/$140 billion U.S. consumption) and about 14.4 percent of U.S. food
          <br>
          production ($20.5 billion California production/$142.5 billion U.S. production). On a net basis, California
          <br>
          production could cover California consumption plus another 2.6 percent of food consumption in other
          <br>
          states.

          Again, grayston, my overarching point is that their is a CRAPLOAD of food in this country, especially coming from CA, and no one is going to starve, even in a really bad situation.
          <br>
          Starvation just isn't an issue.
          <br>
          Do you have an objection to that?

        <p>You are looking short term and missed the rest of the conversation. The Cargill and Monsanto plan is to make all seed a patented product and a sterile product. In effect, if you cannot AFFORD to buy food, by one means or another, you will
          NOT be fed - it has nothing to do with production of quantity BUT CONTROL of the food supply. Also, new laws are being used as a precedent for making it illegal to grow your own food with "wild" seed, under health acts. THIS is the point.
          Food supply CONTROL is the danger here. Monsanto and Cargill are dangerous corporate entities seeking to control food supply. How stupid is our society that it allows this type to manipulation to develop?
          <br>
          <br>
          Keep in mind that eventually we will need to cull the human populations. I don't care what stupid pipe dream some here may have about AI or some other tech giving more "room" for human expansion, the fact is, a tipping point has already
          been reached in the food supply chain and the impact of human existence is the single greatest threat to the planets continued production of the components necessary to our own continued existence (like oxygen and clean water).
          <br>
          <br>
          Here is the scenario - food is totally controlled, you cannot grow your own food (most cannot anyway - too stupid), the economy continues to falter, resource wars break out (read news), production technology begins to falter due to lack of
          end consumers (economic engine shuts down). WHAT are you going to use to buy food with? HOW are you going to grow your own food when seed is only available through approved outlets, costs are high and only licensed growers can buy?
          <br>
          <br>
          Is this far fetched a scenario? YOU tell ME.</p>

          <br>
          Diversion, the Primary Strategy
          <br>
          <br>
          Experience has prevent that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep the public undisciplined and ignorant of the basic system principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused,
          disorganized, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand.
          <br>
          This is achieved by:
          <br>
          <br>
          disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.
          <br>
          engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:
          <br>
          unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers.
          <br>
          giving them what they desire - in excess - "junk food for thought" - and depriving them of what they really need.
          <br>
          <br>
          rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities.
          <br>
          These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology.
          <br>
          The general rule is that there is a profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Diversion Summary
          <br>
          <br>
          Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.
          <br>
          Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history.
          <br>
          <br>
          Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.
          <br>
          <br>
          Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.
          <br>
          <br>
          Consent, the Primary Victory
          <br>
          <br>
          A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available to silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service. (See Studies in
          the Structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source list.)
          <br>
          This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organized data contained in federal and state tax forms, collected, assembled, and submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers.
          <br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator of public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other data sources are given in the Short List of Inputs.
          <br>
          <br>
          Consent Coefficients - numerical feedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for
          surrender and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the
          government.
          <br>
          <br>
          Amplification Energy Sources
          <br>
          <br>
          The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discovering the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of the people to
          labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level, or class in the social structure, i.e., to provide labor at various levels in the pecking order.
          <br>
          Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income, controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure. This provides stability and security, but also government from the top.
          <br>
          <br>
          As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to attain a knowledge of
          energy systems and the ability to enforce their rise through the class structure.
          <br>
          <br>
          This threatens the sovereignty of the elite.
          <br>
          <br>
          If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elite can achieve energy dominance, and labor by consent no longer will hold a position of an essential energy source.
          <br>
          <br>
          Until such energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of people to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration, since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final transfer of
          energy sources to the control of the elite.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is essential to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification.
          <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered.
          <br>
          <br>
          Logistics
          <br>
          <br>
          The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of inputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the inputs and the outputs, and the available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is called logistics.
          <br>
          A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first, and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary factors.
          <br>
          <br>
          This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken down into its subsystems, and these in turn are analyzed, until by this process, one arrives at the logistical "atom," the individual.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is where the process of synthesis propery begins, at the time of birth of the individual.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Artificial Womb
          <br>
          <br>
          From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort is directed towards building, maintaining, and withdrawing into artificial wombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells.
          <br>
          The objective of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stable and unstable activity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes of growth and maturity - i.e., survival; to provide security for freedom
          and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is equally true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Political Structure of a Nation - Dependency
          <br>
          <br>
          The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human god to eliminate all risk
          from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright when they wake up in the morning.
          <br>
          This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering nothing. So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the "godfather"?
          <br>
          <br>
          This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against a disgusting public.
          <br>
          <br>
          Action/Offense
          <br>
          <br>
          Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might raise. Therefore,
          they assign the dirty work to others (including their own children) so as to keep the blood off their hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down
          the street and out of sight. But even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption in government.
          <br>
          Responsibility
          <br>
          <br>
          Again, most people want to be free to do the things (to explore, etc.) but they are afraid to fail.
          <br>
          The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility, and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to others where success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law) which the person is not prepared to
          accept. They want authority (root word - "author"), but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politicians to face reality for them.
          <br>
          <br>
          Summary
          <br>
          <br>
          The people hire the politicians so that the people can:
          <br>
          obtain security without managing it.
          <br>
          obtain action without thinking about it.
          <br>
          inflict theft, injury, and death upon others without having to contemplate either life or death.
          <br>
          avoid responsibility for their own intentions.
          <br>
          obtain the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or learning either of these things.
          <br>
          They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to:
          <br>
          provide for the survival of the nation/womb.
          <br>
          prevent encroachment of anything upon the nation/womb.
          <br>
          destroy the enemy who threatens the nation/womb.
          <br>
          destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the nation/womb.
          <br>
          Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for
          whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The "presidential" level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes
          (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite.
          <br>
          Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a political sub-nation. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its
          substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.
          <br>
          <br>
          System Analysis
          <br>
          <br>
          In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structure - personnel and material alike.
          <br>
          This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems of such a structure.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Draft (As military service)
          <br>
          <br>
          Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the
          young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years
          of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill.
          <br>
          Even more interesting is the process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail,
          nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          We begin with a tentative definition of the draft.
          <br>
          <br>
          The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work. It further serves to make
          the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and sold to the public under the label of "patriotic = national" service.
          <br>
          Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave
          laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an
          extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a
          government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.
          <br>
          <br>
          Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to predeterminate these
          events with maximum certainty. What does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference between automating
          a society and automating a shoe factory.
          <br>
          <br>
          These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated
          beyond the production of national goods and services so as to give the economy a false kinetic energy ("paper" inductance).
          <br>
          <br>
          The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.
          <br>
          <br>
          Enforcement
          <br>
          <br>
          Factor I
          <br>
          As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous.
          <br>
          As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.
          <br>
          <br>
          To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control.
          <br>
          <br>
          Factor II - Father
          <br>
          The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes. The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he
          is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or
          honorable behavior.
          <br>
          By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own
          personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstanding.
          <br>
          <br>
          Factor III - Mother
          <br>
          The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the
          future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to "reality" when it comes, or
          sooner.
          <br>
          As the transition becomes more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must be become more common and legally enforced so as to begin
          the detachment of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate
          woman's power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920.
          <br>
          <br>
          Factor IV - Junior
          <br>
          The emotional pressure for self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield - if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of the pressure finally necessary
          to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends."
          <br>
          Factor V - Sister
          <br>
          And what about junior's sister? She is given all the good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless of the price.
          <br>
          Factor VI - Cattle
          <br>
          Those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same.

        <p>I won't respond to any of your conspiracy theory rhetoric except to say Read your Hayek. Free your mind of the need for "secret elites" to run highly complex systems. They don't exist, and if they did, they wouldn't have the foggiest
          notion of what was what.
          <br>
          <br>
          The immense amount of dataflow would drown them.
          <br>
          <br>
          On the American Civil War: It was one of the most destructive in history. Jay Winik said, per capita, it was more destructive in lives lost and property damaged than WWI.
          <br>
          <br>
          AND YET, America pulled ahead of Great Britain in GDP in a mere five years later!!!
          <br>
          <br>
          No, the Civil War did NOT cause this effect; Northern industrial production was devoted wholly to the war effort. Despite the Civil War, American economic growth roared on.
          <br>
          <br>
          The various points I made about American political, economic, and cultural superiority are descriptive facts. As an American, I approve of them, but my approval is incidental to manifestly obvious Reality.
          <br>
          <br>
          Marx was a hack who pretended to understand economics. Any number of classical liberal economics in the 19th century could out-argue him and make far better predictions on the future of capitalist development than he did. And they did.
          None of Marx's predictions came true. Remember the Iron Law of Wages? Melted like butter. Remember how Western capitalists had to expand and take over the Third World in order to temporarily escape its "contradictions?" Quite the opposite
          happened. 20th century advanced industrial countries found their colonies an economic drag.
          <br>
          <br>
          On Pollution: Pollution is a byproduct (literally) of a comparatively low level of technological development. The horror story of the Ganges is a prime example. Western corporations have no impact at all on life there. Those people live as
          our 19th century farming ancestors lived. For instance, they are utterly dependent on small tanning factories for worked leather for their draft animals. These tanning factories are located on the banks of the Ganges and they dump raw
          sewage into the river. The local government try to rein them in, but they offer no alternatives because they have none. So the effluent pours in, on and on. The remains of animals, even people, float where children swim.
          <br>
          <br>
          As far as Marxism is concerned, read about the devastating environmental catastrophes caused by massive land working projects and the Soviet military and civilian nuclear programs. The stories will curl your hair, and if your hair is
          curly, will straighten it. :(
          <br>
          <br>
          Pollution control can only be bought with wealth, and these people have none. Pollution control can only be effected with high technology and these people have none.
          <br>
          <br>
          As technological development continued in the West, we should not be surprised by how much more effective Western societies and producers got at recapturing effluent and emissions. We are now even mining our landfills for valuable
          materials. To summarize, we buy a clean environment through growing wealth and technological development. We can't do it any other way.
          <br>
          <br>
          On Consumerism: The ability of millions of commoners to enjoy a standard of living even earlier kings and aristocrats would envy is a sure sign of human progress in the arts of production and physical distribution. It isn't something to
          abhor, the way environmentalists and anti-Americans do.
          <br>
          <br>
          On the Singularity. It WILL happen. It may happen earlier or later than Kurzweil predicted, but the overall trends since the Paleollthic Age are clear: human beings improve the precision of their artifacts, they are able to replicate their
          artifacts more easily, and are able to miniaturize their artifacts to good effect over time. I've studied these trends independently of Kurzweil's work and found it to be true.
          <br>
          <br>
          The resulting historical trends of more and more wealth production per capita in growing, developing societies are also beyond dispute. Wars, depressions, dark ages are mere blips on the growth curves.
          <br>
          <br>
          No matter the precise evolution of our route to the oncoming Singularity, the following predictions WILL come true during this century:
          <br>
          <br>
          1 Computers will increase in speed of operation, memory capacity, and numbers of operation per second. They will also decrease in size. As Kurzweil pointed out, not only has Moore's Law NOT been repealed, it has speeded up.
          <br>
          <br>
          2 Computer chips will be embedded in more and more consumer items; result, we will live in an increasingly intelligent environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          3 We will find it easier to interact with our technology through the development of smart implants.
          <br>
          <br>
          4. Production will come home. This is already happening in what Toffler called our symbols-manipulation sector as more and more office workers and other people who are able to work on laptops and desktops are able to stay home and get
          their work done. As nanotechnology develops, production itself will move home in what I call kitchen vats and garage vats. Read Drexler's description of how nanotechnology could "grow" a rocket engine for a hint of what I am talking about.
          <br>
          <br>
          5. Recycling will become total. Pollution will be a thing of the past. Remember what I said about pollution being an effect of low tech? Well, as nanotechnology advances, EVERY SINGLE MOLECULE will become a valuable resource. No one will
          throw anything away. When damaged or worn out, an item will be recycled in the vats. Vats will become ubiquitous as nanotech becomes able to replicate the vats themselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          6. Your solar power satellites scenario will come true. The real hangup now is the necessity to ship every component into space. Very expensive per pound. Once we mine the Moon and the asteroids, raw material in space will be far easier to
          come by, and with nanotechnology, will become easy as pie to manipulate. Nuclear facilities, hydrogen, and extremely efficient solar cells and fuel cells for energy storage will be ubiquitous.
          <br>
          <br>
          7. Result of ALL OF THE ABOVE? An extremely decentralized world, extremely rich, extremely free...and this is BEFORE the Singularity's arrival (this is "merely" the Nanotechnology Society at work).
          <br>
          <br>
          8. The ancient dreams of tyrants and kings will finally DIE as technological revolutions power the necessary political revolutions around the world that will free everyone, everywhere.
          <br>

        <p>"I won't respond to any of your conspiracy theory rhetoric except"
          <br>
          <br>
          Labels like that are Disinformation, a cop-out. It's funny, but I've recently read a myriad of MSM editorials which include the phrase "it used to be only conspiracy theorists ..." while acknowledging revelations regarding illegal
          repression of dissent at G8 and other meetings of the Global Corporatists, pipeline route planning through Afghanistan, the lies about Iran, etc.
          <br>
          <br>
          My first thought is always "Who determines who is called a 'conspiracy theorist? Why, Editors and News Directors". Perhaps, if these people are incessantly having their opinions vindicated, the media should stop tossing this childish label
          about, and start listening to these people.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Free your mind of the need for "secret elites" to run highly complex systems."
          <br>
          <br>
          It is, however, a fact that there are webs of power flowing from a number of related secretive organizations, which excercise unparralelled political and economic power, without oversight or public input. So you've failed on that count
          already.
          <br>
          <br>
          "AND YET, America pulled ahead of Great Britain in GDP in a mere five years later!!!"
          <br>
          <br>
          Right. But slavery didn't die out overnight, America was drawing immense wealth from colonial projects, while Europe was losing them, and the industrial infrastructure had been built to support the war.
          <br>
          <br>
          "The various points I made about American political, economic, and cultural superiority are descriptive facts."
          <br>
          <br>
          No, they aren't. And that's fairly irrelevant to the present situation, of a wholly-corrupt political-economic system out of control.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Marx was a hack who pretended to understand economics."
          <br>
          <br>
          Not really. He understood that economics is a SOCIAL SCIENCE, and it is Neo-Classical Economics that is proving to be the failing model.
          <br>
          <br>
          "On Pollution: Pollution is a byproduct (literally) of a comparatively low level of technological development."
          <br>
          <br>
          Actually, it's a by-product of an economic ideology which classifies the necessities of life as "externalities" and any concerns about their destruction "barriers to growth".
          <br>
          <br>
          "Western corporations have no impact at all on life there."
          <br>
          <br>
          Bohpal ...
          <br>
          <br>
          "we buy a clean environment through growing wealth and technological development."
          <br>
          <br>
          That's part of it. But you can't pretend that the economic theory of "perpetual growth" will somehow reverse this problem. All of the things you mention are a drop in the bucket compared to the environmental degradation that continues 24
          hours a day, 7 days a week.
          <br>
          <br>
          "On Consumerism: The ability of millions of commoners to enjoy a standard of living even ..."
          <br>
          <br>
          Indeed, this is great, but we are not taught to appreciate this great wealth. We are taught that no matter how much we waste and accumulate, it's never enough (even though 'item x' may finally complete you), and this produces much more
          waste and depression than we need. This paradigm is solely for the production of profit for a small minority, and represents an unsustainable way of organizing human affairs.
          <br>
          <br>
          And again, you toss about childish labels, which only highlights the indefensibility of your position.
          <br>
          <br>
          "The resulting historical trends of more and more wealth production per capita in growing, developing societies are also beyond dispute."
          <br>
          <br>
          But the fact that this model is unsustainable, and thus, more pressing than ever, is also beyond dispute. You keep making a circular argument with no conclusion.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Wars, depressions, dark ages are mere blips on the growth curves."
          <br>
          <br>
          And therein lies the main point of failure in neo-classical economics ...
          <br>
          <br>
          "1 Computers will increase in speed of operation, memory capacity, and numbers of operation per second."
          <br>
          <br>
          Great. So what?
          <br>
          <br>
          "2 Computer chips will be embedded in more and more consumer items; result, we will live in an increasingly intelligent environment."
          <br>
          <br>
          I have mixed feelings on this. Not sure that gadgets and gimmicks can be classified as "intelligent".
          <br>
          <br>
          "3 We will find it easier to interact with our technology through the development of smart implants."
          <br>
          <br>
          Mixed feelings again ... How will this make it easier? Will we somehow discover a way to fix the existing problems with electronic devices? Do you understand the level of stress and anxiety this overload has already caused?
          <br>
          <br>
          "4. Production will come home."
          <br>
          <br>
          Certainly. As the corporations that destroyed the country move their headquarters to now-developing economies, they'll still need sweatshops!
          <br>
          <br>
          The existing economic model, coupled with Governmental corruption and conflicts of interest sent it away in the first place.
          <br>
          <br>
          "5. Recycling will become total. Pollution will be a thing of the past."
          <br>
          <br>
          I'll believe this when I see it, or see some effort to undo the paradigm of Government by VP/CEO.
          <br>
          <br>
          "6. Your solar power satellites scenario will come true."
          <br>
          <br>
          I hope so.
          <br>
          <br>
          "7. Result of ALL OF THE ABOVE? An extremely decentralized world, extremely rich, extremely free..."
          <br>
          <br>
          There are many more pressing issues you've ignored that will have to be addressed before most of that can happen. ONe of the first will have to be a comlete paradigm shift where economics is concerned.
          <br>

          Not if the tyrants still control the most advanced technology, and attempt to use it to contain the populace, as is evident in programs such as with RFID.

          <br>
          <br>
          I define conspiracy theory thusly: The assumption that a very few people can secretly manipulate successfully a very large, complex process to their benefit.
          <br>
          <br>
          The problem with conspiracy theories is that they demand the existence of perfect conspirators--ones who don't blab to outsiders, yet can competently communicate with fellow conspirators, who understand precisely when and where to act, who
          comprehend wholly the system they are attempting to manipulate, in short, the kind of people socialists envision running the Workers Paradise...which seems never to turn out the way they wish.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you have any working knowledge of human institutions and human limits, you'll understand why any conspiracy must break down soon after being attempted.
          <br>
          <br>
          "It is, however, a fact that there are webs of power flowing from a number of related secretive organizations, which excercise unparralelled political and economic power, without oversight or public input. So you've failed on that count
          already."
          <br>
          <br>
          No it isn't. The only fact that's pertinent to this discussion is that individuals have unequal access and connections in a free society. Conspiracy theorists translate this truism into the purported existence of Supermen Who Run
          Everything.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Right. But slavery didn't die out overnight, America was drawing immense wealth from colonial projects, while Europe was losing them, and the industrial infrastructure had been built to support the war."
          <br>
          <br>
          The Civil War was, per capita, one of the most destructive in history, especially in the South. Slavery no longer existed, and the infrastructure antebellum slaves had helped their white masters build was almost wholly destroyed. The
          massive economic growth recorded postbellum was almost wholly achieved by Northern free labor and their growing industrial infrastructure.
          <br>
          <br>
          My point here was that DESPITE the Civil War's carnage, American wealth and power grew rapidly. America had no empire at that point in time. You're probably confusing postbellum America with that of 1898 when we relieved Spain of the
          remainder of her empire. And even then, America's mini-empire was dwarfed by the American nation-state. Some of the islands in that mini-empire served as handy coal refueling stops, but most of it actually drew wealth FROM America instead
          of sending wealth TO America.

          He didn't understand the first thing about economics. The assumption that economic systems are historically overdetermined, that there are only two economic classes that are engaged in a war to the death, that economic decision-making was
          becoming concentrated in natural monopolies industry by industry, that workers' wages must fall, that wealthy societies steal their wealth from poor countries, etc., etc., have all proven false. As I said, Marx was a hack.

          "On Pollution: Pollution is a byproduct (literally) of a comparatively low level of technological development."

          <br>
          "Actually, it's a by-product of an economic ideology which classifies the necessities of life as "externalities" and any concerns about their destruction "barriers to growth"."
          <br>
          <br>
          Think about what pollution is. It's not some eerily weird material, unnatural in its makeup. Its material that at our present technological level WE CAN'T USE NOW. So we vent it into the air, water, and deposit it in landfills. When we
          have achieved the precision, replication, miniaturization of full-fledged nanotechnology, EVERYTHING becomes useful--a resource. EVERYTHING becomes far too valuable to throw away. And the aforementioned precision, replication, and
          miniaturization will give us the wherewithall to recycle what would've been waste ON THE SPOT.
          <br>
          <br>
          This is one of the realizations I had almost immediately when first reading Engines of Creation by Eric Drexler.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Western corporations have no impact at all on life there."
          <br>
          <br>
          "Bohpal ..."
          <br>
          <br>
          To an extremely limited extant. India is a continental nation, almost as large as America. How much damage to America as a whole would an industrial accident in one factory do to America? About as much as the Bohpal plant did to India as a
          whole. The Ganges pollution did not derive from modern chemical factories, but by such agricultural types of installations as tanning factories.
          <br>
          <br>
          "we buy a clean environment through growing wealth and technological development."
          <br>
          <br>
          "That's part of it. But you can't pretend that the economic theory of "perpetual growth" will somehow reverse this problem. All of the things you mention are a drop in the bucket compared to the environmental degradation that continues 24
          hours a day, 7 days a week."
          <br>
          <br>
          That's the whole of it. We wouldn't even have to wait for a full-fledged singularity in order to live, tens of billions of us, on Earth, all of us, as well as the wealthiest of Americans. All we need is full-fledged nanotechnology.

          "Indeed, this is great, but we are not taught to appreciate this great wealth. We are taught that no matter how much we waste and accumulate, it's never enough (even though 'item x' may finally complete you), and this produces much more

          <br>
          <br>
          Our waste and accumulation are artifacts of our comparatively low levels of productive technologies. What do you suppose would happen to waste and accumulation once we can build ANYTHING out of atoms and molecules? Why have a lot of extras
          lying about when you can just throw them into your nanotech vat for recycling? Then grow it again when you need it?

          <br>
          <br>
          It's easily sustainable as we continue to learn to build more precisely, replicate with ease, and miniaturize products and the means of production. See above comments.

          Neoclassical economics doesn't say much about really long-term trends (dating back to paleolithic days). But I do and so does Robert Wright in Non-Zero, and so does Ray Kurzweil, to good effect.
          <br>
          <br>
          "1 Computers will increase in speed of operation, memory capacity, and numbers of operation per second."
          <br>
          <br>
          "Great. So what?"
          <br>
          <br>
          Read Kurzweil and find out so what.

          Just think of them as adjuncts to human intelligence, libraries and the Internet instantly retrievable by our minds. I have no problems with this future development at all.

          <br>
          <br>
          The existing economic model, coupled with Governmental corruption and conflicts of interest sent it away in the first place."
          <br>
          <br>
          Why bother with corporations if you can "grow your own" with your own easily replicated vats and replicated software? As I said, nanotechnology will lead to more changes than the agricultural, industrial and information revolutions
          combined. Including what will be an abrupt change of every single economic system known to man.

          <br>
          <br>
          Again, corporations and government will have little to do with this. If people want to grow their own, they'll need feedstocks, including grungy old clothes, dead leaves, sewage, food leavings, etc. So they'll keep all this suddenly
          valuable stuff and recycle it.

          The point is, everyone will control the technology, meaning no one tyrant can control it. Undoubtably some will try, but they will fail. What if they gave a tyranny but nobody came?

          It matters little how you "define" the phrase. The fact that you toss it about, instead of simply making a point, undermines your position and credibility.

          You're actually arguing that compiracies don't happen? They happen all the time, and even if they don't always succeed, they often do.
          <br>
          <br>
          You speak as if people aren't capable of such things, or that entire agencies don't do this type of thing professionally.
          <br>
          <br>
          And then you go on to arbitrarily connect "socialists" (who, specifically?) with "conspiracy theorists", again reinforcing my point.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is, however, a fact that there are webs of power flowing from a number of related secretive organizations, which excercise unparralelled political and economic power, without oversight or public input. So you've failed on that count
          already.

          Indeed, this is great, but we are not taught to appreciate this great wealth. We are taught that no matter how much we waste and accumulate, it's never enough (even though 'item x' may finally complete you), and this produces much more

          <br>
          "4. Production will come home."
          <br>
          <br>
          The existing economic model, coupled with Governmental corruption and conflicts of interest sent it away in the first place.
          <br>
          <br>
          "Why bother with corporations if you can "grow your own" with your own easily replicated ..."
          <br>
          <br>
          Because I can't. Neither can you.
          <br>
          <br>
          "5. Again, corporations and government will have little to do with this."
          <br>
          <br>
          I doubt that very much.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are many more pressing issues you've ignored that will have to be addressed before most of that can happen. ONe of the first will have to be a comlete paradigm shift where economics is concerned.
          <br>
          <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.truecosteconomics.org/" target="_blank">http://www.truecosteconomics.org</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          "Paradigm shifts come easily when technology changes."
          <br>
          <br>
          Indeed. I was addressing the current situation.
          <br>
          <br>
          Not if the tyrants still control the most advanced technology, and attempt to use it to contain the populace, as is evident in programs such as with RFID.
          <br>
          <br>
          "The point is, everyone will control the technology, meaning no one tyrant can control it."
          <br>
          <br>
          That's all very nice, but how do you propose we get there from where we are right now?

        <p>When I describe strong possibilities for relatively near future technological advances, you dismiss these as fantasies, ignoring the fact that they are based on very long-term technological trends dating back to paleolithic times.
          <br>
          <br>
          It's an extremely serious mistake for any political activist or commentators to disregard these trends. Your mental map of our current technological infrastructure is out of date...and so is mine. The only realistic assessment we can make
          of our future is to take near-future technologies into account RIGHT NOW.
          <br>
          <br>
          In every generation, our toolmakers and machinists have gotten just a little more precise in their work processes. In every generation, they've gotten better at replicating their work (interchangeable parts in American 19th century
          factories merely made this trend extremely obvious to observers). In every generation, they've gotten better at making their machinery smaller. These three trends, along with the computerization described by Kurweil and others as following
          Moore's Law, make nanotechnology inevitable.
          <br>
          <br>
          We already are producing the beginnings of the nanotechnology revolution in a variety of materials that work better, being made of very tiny particles. We are also making microtechnology precursors to nanotechnology right now. To call this
          work fairy tales is to disregard Reality.
          <br>
          <br>
          But then you have the nerve to turn around and offer your own socialist dreams of the future based on nothing but Marxian wishful thinking. Never mind how much of a fairy tale it is.
          <br>
          <br>
          Which do you think is more likely to happen based on a realistic reading of human nature, our needs, desires, and moral and ethical limits: Achieving the Workers Paradise through the simultaneous achievement of disinterested class
          consciousness and socialist solidarity by hundreds of millions of people, or increasing accelerating development of a variety of technologies that enable individuals to live their own lives?
          <br>
          <br>
          Which one would be more desirable?
          <br>
          <br>
          I am not a libertarian, but I'm very partial to their economic vision of individuals living lives as individuals, rather than having them scripted by their commissar masters.
          <br>
          <br>
          I believe the vision of the future offered by Drexler and Kurzweil is not only more desirable than yours, but is also very doable.
          <br>
          <br>
          Marxism, even taking it at its word in its vision for the future, is not desirable, nor is it attainable.
          <br>
          <br>
          I stand by every word I wrote in this debate.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          No. It's just that I was addressing things as they actually are, not speculating on what may come about someday, to magically make all these problems caused by our economic system go away so neatly, as a way of avoiding any real response
          to these issues.
          <br>
          <br>
          "It's an extremely serious mistake for any political activist or commentators to disregard these trends."
          <br>
          <br>
          I don't disregard them. It's just they weren't a part of our debate on the economic system, and your raising them appears to be a way of avoiding any substantive debate about the failures of the neo-classical system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Don't get me wrong. I hope this all comes to pass, especially as seamlessly as you've described.
          <br>
          <br>
          But I'm talking about what exists right now, not somewhere down the road, if someone develops it just as you've described, which doesn't seem likely in the short-term.
          <br>
          <br>
          "In every generation, our toolmakers and machinists have gotten just a little more precise in their work processes."
          <br>
          <br>
          Right. But my computer still crashes every now and then, and a proper and reliable program for the work that I do can't be written.
          <br>
          <br>
          "But then you have the nerve to turn around and offer your own socialist dreams of the future"
          <br>
          <br>
          Where did I do this?
          <br>
          <br>
          "Which do you think is more likely to happen based on a realistic reading of human nature, our needs, desires, and moral and ethical limits: Achieving the Workers Paradise through the simultaneous achievement of disinterested class
          consciousness and socialist solidarity by hundreds of millions of people, or increasing accelerating development of a variety of technologies that enable individuals to live their own lives?"
          <br>
          <br>
          This isn't an "A" or "B" conversation, and you appear to be avoiding most of what I said.
          <br>
          <br>
          "I am not a libertarian, but I'm very partial to their economic vision of individuals living lives as individuals, rather than ..."
          <br>
          <br>
          That's fine. Neo-Classical Economics is still a failed, unsustainable model.
          <br>
          <br>
          "I believe the vision of the future offered by Drexler and Kurzweil is not only more desirable than yours ..."
          <br>
          <br>
          Again, I didn't offer one ...
          <br>
          <br>
          "Marxism, even taking it at its word in its vision for the future, is not desirable"
          <br>
          <br>
          Perhaps. But that wasn't my point.
          <br>
          <br>
          I simply pointed out the fact that were were wrong in your off-handed dismissal of the man's work.
          <br>
          <br>
          I stand by every word I wrote in this debate.

              <br>
              <br>
              So that YOU may understand better my position, Sally, I am the ultimate capitalist. You want Gold? Oil? Military Hardware? A small country? What? (Just a little inside joke). I am a realist with the curse of a conscience and
              intelligence. It is often a stumbling block in my quest for ever increasing profits and the dealings I must have with all manner of persons. Yet, I realize that money and power are what it takes to effect change. Indeed. I realize that
              my children and their children will have to live with the decisions I make, and the ones that you make. The ideals you seem to think are still alive in America are not here any more, and therefore, we are ALL in jeopardy. NO Empire
              last forever. Some are short lived and others undergo metamorphosis in order to keep the elite on top... The only constant is change. Why hate China or India? (It is evident in your fatherland undertones). Embrace them as mutual
              partners for progress in the right directions.

              <center>
                <p class="mindxquote"> I stumbled upon Welch's essay when checking Kurzweil's site. It interested me. And I felt I had to respond to the ill-thought-out Marxists' responses to it. No moderator contacted me for comment. </p>

              <br>
              <br>
              I'd like to point out a few facts first about Karl Marx:
              <br>
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              While I do not personally embrace communistic doctrine, I realize that the communism of today and the twisting of history have little to do with the tenets of Marxism. per se. Similarly, just as the Baptists are zealots and the
              Catholics are corrupt in ideology - each far and well removed from the original teachings of Jesus (for good example and balance) - so I say, is the modern communistic and Marxist dogma. If you read the link above and educated yourself
              a little, you would realize that there are many merits in his work and that the man was a brilliant and hard working man - hated because he railed against the rapidly dominating materialism based societies that were arising from
              unfettered and corrupted versions of capitalism. If you really want to know what capitalism is and where it comes from, read on:
              <br>
              <br>
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              While flawed in its own right, Marxism is not some evil in and of itself - it is an ideal for some, if only because it is counter to the extreme forms of capitalism that have caused a huge inequity in the world. Your liberal use of
              language in context is some evidence of your un-educated bias of all things intellectually stimulating - knowing both sides of the coin allow one to be balanced. THIS IS WHY I debate as I do - to counter the other extreme you have
              shown here - an extreme I see mainstream among those educated (= indoctrinated) in the current system of schools. It is readily apparent that you are thoroughly indoctrinated by the schools of Consumerism, and I must say it is obvious
              that you cannot but abhor anything counter to your programming.
              <br>
              <br>
              One could note that Karl Marx was greatly supported and funded by many so-called elite in the United States and that it was the USA corporations (names withheld) that backed the bloody revolution of the Bolsheviks in order to gain
              access to mining rights and other resources in Russia at the time. IT WAS CAPITALISM THAT GAVE COMMUNISM ITS BIRTH! Read a book other than the Agenda for A New American World Order, please. You might find out WHY EVERYONE mistrusts the
              government here - not you or I (The People), but the corrupt capitalist OWNERS of the former free Republic of America. I LOVE my country, yet I allow myself to THINK freely... this empowers me to contribute to THE PEOPLE, not the
              corporations.
              <br>

              So, in summation, maybe only intellectuals can see all sides of the paradigm, Ma'am, and those self centered zealot prophets of evangelical, nationalistic capitalism cannot. They are through and through, products of system. Good for
              consumption and further propagation of like minded ilk. So that I am crystal clear on my perception of "it" - Capitalism itself is not evil, it is an advanced function of society, necessary to keep the interchange of commerce between
              entities flowing, however IT IS THE EASE by which the corrupt can take advantage of its flawed mechanism of organization and control that are dangerous! Note that there are indeed many forms of capitalism and the main thrust of MY
              argument is that the one here in the United States is critically flawed, biased in its service to the public good and obviously completely manipulated for gain by ONLY a select few at the detriment of The People at large - contrary to
              the ideals this country were founded on (FACT).

              How many people on this thread actually read "The Singularity is Near" and Drexler's work on nanotechnology? How many thought through the startling implications on our lives? If they did, how could they bring such inane 19th century
              Marxist analysis to a very clearly 21st century advanced technology topic?
              <br>
              <br>
              Thought through the startling implications? This is hollow language. I can think through any fantasy I want, doesn't make it any more REAL. I have read and seen many things (including the above and deeper works on the subjects) and
              would caution against taking any ONE man's word for the future. NO ONE can predict the outcome of complex interactions, cause and effect that weave what we call the future. Yes, these technologies are being developed at a good clip,
              but there are factors OTHER that the technology itself, that make the eventual APPLICATION of that technology VIABLE. What you are asking us to do is look through a tube and ignore the peripheral reality of cause and effect. ECONOMICS
              and POLITICS have far more bearing on the eventual actualization of technology than the persons dreaming of and developing the technology do themselves! Here is a prime example: I know a group of engineers and assorted scientific
              leaders in their fields that have developed, ready for market, a satellite system capable of beaming energy directly to the Earth via laser beam at certain frequency. The technology is thoroughly trial tested and has been developed to
              a point where it can be used to power 4GW power plants in each array. You want to know the sad truth about American Capitalism and its so-called free market? They have to sell this power system to the Chinese because they are under
              threats (life and limb) against using this technology in America - the power kings here in the free market called America, control the APPLICATION of technology simply because profit and control is the MOST important thing - so, while
              you pay through the nose for energy and use polluting tech, keep in mind that AMERICAN capitalism PREVENTS the use of this technology! Whereas, in a "socialist" or "communist" capitalistic society, the demands of the people are first,
              not a few individuals.
              <br>
              <br>
              A small additional Off Topic caveat for you: Over "there", they execute people like Enron CEO's (GREAT POLICY!) and officials that are corrupt, WHEN that corruption costs the lives of the people or equally damaging. Hmmmm. All facts
              lady. Who's system is more progressive and protective of the whose society at large??? Is it getting clear?
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              How could they miss the fact that the self-organizing nature of American civilization meshes far better with accelerating change (actually spurs it on in many cases)in comparison to status quo environmentalism, outdated Marxist class
              consciousness, or stodgy tradition European thought?
              <br>
              <br>
              Enquiring minds want to know.
              <br>
              <br>
              None of this makes any sense - it is more empty language driven by an emotional mind. The self-organizing nature of American civilization - a fact? WOW! Are you for real? Self-organizing - every one is, even Russia, even an amoeba -
              don't use this fools language here. This is dumb dumb language used by politicians to fill empty heads with empty words (no meaning). Nature of American civilization??? What IS THAT? First, there is no one culture or "civilization" in
              America - it is a hodge-podge of competing cultures, most of which mistrust and even openly despise each other in increasing fervor! All that we have today, has been held together by a strict Anglo-Saxon code of governance and has only
              remained "stable" BECAUSE of the ruling elite being homogeneous Anglo-Saxon in culture!! FACT, whether you like it or not, politically correct or not - IT IS REALITY. This is rapidly giving way to a cold civil war now that the "other"
              competing ideologies of differing cultures have wealth within their ranks - this is a NEW phenomena and not calculated, obviously, by your great sage, Welch. The very same MISTAKE of the Roman empire has been repeated. You CANNOT
              maintain a functional Republic without perpetuating a singular doctrine of belief that UNITES the multitude of differing cultures within your borders, usually in the form of a religion, a common enemy, a moral code, an education system
              (there are many ways) - Currently here in America - giving them (other cultures) free reign IS THE PROBLEM! THEY DO NOT HAVE the interests of the "other" Americans at heart or even America itself. Watch rallies lately?? Any one?
              "Tolerance" being the idiots catch word and the fools errand. Living in peace and freely vetted as an individual means keeping your culture and your ideology OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE and TO YOURSELF - Tolerance for these competing
              cultures is the destruction of an Empire. Individual freedom of PRIVATE expression is the key. Not my philosophy, just read history. Without LOGICAL and CALCULATED, SINGULAR precepts of governance and culture, all things WILL collapse
              upon themselves - PROVEN by endless volumes of world history. You, apparently are part of that experiment, whereas consumerism is the defining cultural playing field that all groups will interact on here in America. HA ha ha. This is
              the funniest thing ever, since great in-equality exists within the State and without - eventual rebellion will result. Especially soon when people can't buy food here... get it yet? American consumerism is a SICKNESS that infects the
              people with low intelligence, sloth, low self-esteem, short attention spans, un-disciplined behaviours and on and on and on - EVIDENCE? Watch the local news in (insert your home city). Obtuse if you think THIS works. It MAY APPEAR to
              work better than other systems, and it may indeed, which is a poor testament to mans achievements, but it is still DEEPLY flawed and destructive to man kind in general - it is amoral and wrought with every selfish vice known.
              <br>
              <br>
              How you compare this to other forms of governance is one thing, but keep this in mind - CONSUMERISM knows no nationality and neither do the corporations running this country!! The very same corporations that are training our kids in
              school, starting wars for profit and making you eat the sh*t food we find on the shelves of our "free" country. The "America" corporations care NOTHING or America or its People. Are you really that brainwashed? I'd suggest getting the
              McFAt burger out of your mouth for starters since it is scientifically proven to screw up your body, and therefore your mind. Courtesy of American capitalism. Poison food. Lead toys (YES - AMERICAN company, outsourcing in China - blame
              the Chinese though, right?). War machine. MINDLESS TV selling sh*t to American kids. GREAT system indeed. Better than a dictatorship? Of course. Better than a Socialist state where NO ONE goes hungry or dies from lack of medical care -
              or even a poor, backwards country where people live off the land? You be the judge. I think that here we must look at the GOOD in EACH system, whether Marxist or Capitalist and use the ELEMENTS that are beneficially in EACH and
              eliminate the destructive forces. You would rather we embrace the one-sided??
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The Marxists posting on this thread may disdain American capitalism and American politics, but they should remember a few facts:
              <br>
              <br>
              I don't think any one here is a Marxist, although from my post above, you may feel so inclined... You're just an uber-nationalist and from your tone, would probably welcome fascism as long as it was "American" in brand - it's obvious
              to the one with eye open.
              <br>
              <br>
              As to how any one CAN NOT disdain American politics is beyond me. American politics is the reason why the country is failing the grade (literally). The Founding Fathers (Masons I will add, not religious fools) did NOT envision a
              country run by political families, but by free men bound to public service when the NEED arose, not as a means of graft and lifestyle! It is SURELY UN-American, what is now called "American Politics". YOU should remember a few facts,
              like American history - the one they don't teach in school any more.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              1. American capitalism is by far the most productive and creative in the world. Check any list of comparative GDPs.
              <br>
              <br>
              Bullsh*t. GDP's are NOT a measure of anything worthwhile lady!! What if my GDP was higher than yours, but I had to kill a million civilians to do it and destroy an entire eco-system to accomplish it? IDIOT. Productive? DESTRUCTIVE,
              INVASIVE are better words describing the actual net result. Yeah, you got a fancy wardrobe, but the kids who stitched it together are slaves, where once they were farmers and free people - they country where it is produced reduced to
              environmental ruin for you. Consumerism destroyed their culture so you can have a coffee maker. THIS IS PROGRESS? Creativity? YOU are an unworldly person and so narrow in mind that you only see what you WANT to see. There is a PRICE
              for everything and I, for one, am not willing to accept the destruction of one man for the gain of another. America's wealth (and the wealth of MANY OTHER nations TOO) is built on WAR and destruction of entire races of people, cultures
              and ways of living - in the name of progress (i.e.; a bigger luxury for you). THIS is the GREAT IN-EQUALITY I keep referring to and the chief catalyst for our current state of affairs globally. Does it look pretty to you? Oh - they
              must be terrorists or rebels or Marxists or communists or just plain dumb native folks, huh?! Same lingo, different times. Just words make it easy for you to justify your destruction of peoples, environment and liberty. "THEY" are
              f*cking people, lady. Your brand of consumerism is their death. Remember that fact. Oh - and I can back mine up with historical references all day long - we'll start with the first White settlers that landed in the New World...
              progress indeed.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              2. American capitalism has been so since 1870 (5 years after the bloody and destructive Civil War!) when it officially surpassed Great Britain, a sure sign of long-term durability and competitive zest.
              <br>
              <br>
              What? The CAUSE of the civil war WAS exactly so:
              <br>
              <br>
              Northern industry that controlled politics in the North wanted total control over the Southern production - the Southerners were selling and trading with England at much better terms than the Northern business men!! So, in order to
              destroy the South's ability to remain sovereign economically and to capture the production capability of the South for PURE PROFIT for ONLY THE Northern Business Men - they orchestrated the civil war. I can go on and give details,
              facts and figures (but I tire) including the fact that Abraham Lincoln himself, in a letter to his wife, admitted that the slavery issue was a ruse and that HE HIMSELF did not see the Black Man as equal to White! Wonder why the US
              Penny looks the way it does, head left, color dark??? Hero to WHOM? But in order to "unify" the country, the Slavery issue was brought to the forefront so that the English subjects would rise in popular opposition to the British
              military support of the South. The entire political premise was a fake out. On top of that, Abraham Lincoln and his puppeteers destroyed the sovereignty of the States and helped create the unbalanced power of the Federal government we
              have now in clear violation of the original intents of this country! Here is a definition of fascism for your info: "Various scholars attribute different characteristics to fascism, but the following elements are usually seen as its
              integral parts: patriotism, nationalism, statism, militarism, totalitarianism, anti-communism, economic planning (including corporatism and autarky), populism, collectivism, autocracy and anti-liberalism (i.e., opposition to political
              and economic liberalism)." Are you paying attention now? Or still in denial? Probably a sympathizer...
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              3. American capitalism is legalized and protected by a proven, long-term, stable, durable Democratic Republic, better known as the United States of America. India and China should wish for such competence.
              <br>
              <br>
              What does this drivel mean, really? Legalized? ANYONE can legalize anything. Protected? (Means we will blow up your country if you don't give us your "insert enemy's resource here") Look at Africa for evidence. Long term, stable
              Democratic Republic??? China and India should learn...?? Lady, I'm an American through and through, but not an idiot, I recognize my own weaknesses and my faults. China has been around as a country WAY longer than ANY Western
              civilization, including the Roman Empire. Are you kidding me? India too, although India is a screwed up country all around due to total corruption (mob democracy at work). China, on the other hand is STILL the Han Dynasty. The
              communist revolution was a RETURN of the Dynasty, chasing out the foreigners that were exploiting the indigenous Chinese masses!! Who do you think the Taiwanese are?! Manchus. A situation where 10% ruled 90% and slaved them all in a
              highly capitalistic society, no less. The Mao revolution was not about communism, but about returning power to the people - the ideals of communism made it easier for Mao to unify under a single doctrine, that's all. America, on the
              other hand, is a child nation, newly birthed compared to... EVERYONE ELSE (except the new puppet governments we are popping up all over the place). You really need a history lesson. Competence? We are losing the resource war to China.
              We are losing the ONLY war that will declare a winner. Competence? Better check yourself before you wreck yourself on that one. This is survival, not games or semantical language describing a form of government! R-E-A-L-I-T-Y.
              <br>
              <br>
              Let it be known that as an American soldier, business man and scholar, I recognize this as a country founded on Masonic principles of logic and reason, equality of life and a recognition of the grand architect of life. I seek free and
              open discourse and un-inhibited travel between nations, the erasing of borders and ideas to each sovereign nation in the name of liberty and duty for ALL peoples on earth - not the elite corporations of America, China and Europe that
              keep us divided by using the tools of false commerce and consumerism. Be warned that the religious and nationalistic forces that infest our country and its politics and business are the DEATH of our great experiment - watch for them,
              they are manipulative and clever (different from intelligent). They are the lowest of low. Great dividers and pundits of mechanical progress at the cost of humanity.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              4. America is by far the LEAST polluting of ANY of the great industrialized countries in the world. Read the recent Smithsonian magazine's horror story about the Ganges River for disgusting details on genuine pollution.
              <br>
              <br>
              NOT TRUE AT ALL. China and India, yes, for sure. Call them on trying to play catch up so we that they don't get taken over by the American Corporations. Can you blame them? No. Besides, it's YOUR consumption causing this. As for Europe
              - most have their act together and are LIGHT YEARS ahead of us in clean living. All day long. Get your facts right and read something NOT printed in the USA for less "spin".
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              5. American culture truly values entrepreneurial inventiveness on the part of INDIVIDUALS. Ask the Marxists on this thread how much they value individualism. Not much, I'd wager.
              <br>
              <br>
              Not really true any more. In the past, individuals could create and bring to market with relative ease in America, but now you can get killed, black-balled and just plain crushed if your technology takes away profit from those already
              running the show. FACT. I just gave you one real life example at the beginning of this post concerning abundant, clean and "liberating" energy - problem is, it gives too much, too soon, to the People. xxxxxx Power can't have that, now
              can they? Gotta increase the bottom line like all good corporations do.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              And now, to make a point that may only seem to you to be off topic. IF (and I mean IF) China and India, the EU and Brazil, and any other contenders begin to approach American economic mastery, WILL it be too late for them, in terms of
              geopolitical balance of power concerns...IF the Singularity is also approaching, and perhaps happens?
              <br>
              <br>
              You are a wishful dreamer living in a Utopian fascist fantasy. It is all clear in your use of the English language. Every word filled with contempt for all "non" American peoples and countries. Your like-minded ilk are why we cannot
              live in peace with anyone. A reason WHY American Economic Mastery exists in the first place - un-equal distribution of wealth versus un-equal effort on the part of those laboring to bring the fruits to market. It is a diabolical
              paradigm based on a War Machine economy that sucks the life blood from its citizens, and where bankers steal and siphon the individual wealth of all free Americans of all creeds, races and positions in society. While I personally
              appreciate wealth and realize it as the right of anyone capable of developing their personal wealth - However, NOT on the BACKS of others without fair trade of value for labor received - which is the MAIN reason WHY so many super rich
              live in America. On the backs of people barely more than slaves - producing our goods, cleaning our messes and doing our dirty work. Hence the immigration issue! It is now, surely a class system, fool, and hence the coming civil war of
              cultures in America.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I'll answer my own question with Ray Kurzweil's own prognostications: According to his analysis of Moore's Law and other trends, the Singularity is due sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. There is no way in Aitch Eeee Double Hockey Sticks
              that ANY nation could make a serious move on the American lead in that comparatively short amount of time.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although I respect his vision as powerfully sharp and his analysis of future trends as promising, Ray is not God, so I'll skip the Hail Ray to prognostication. Moore's law is already bunk (proven false) and so, I am sure, are many of
              your "trends". Where have you been?
              <br>
              <br>
              This is not about anyone "making moves" on America. It is about survival, in case you didn't notice. The race you see towards progress and prosperity is one that each nation runs - they run it to keep their respective populations fed,
              clothed, educated and content, just like us Americans here at home. Your language seems to reflect a position that America should be the only one entitled to power and position of prestige... We need to have a ONE world view in order
              for mankind to survive and prosper. The Singularity, if realized in the current political state of affairs will be a great tool of destruction and evil. The geo-political reality is that mostly selfish and self-serving men rule the
              earth today and any power of this magnitude should be kept far away from any nation, including the USA. Until the developers of this technology realize this and use this AI to seize power for themselves, I feel it prudent NOT to wish
              for Singularity and its predecessors. While human nature requires always an elite to rule and sell the ideals of civilization as they see it, I believe only a scientist elite would be best for mankind, not a political or corporate one
              (for now at least until the next "leap"). This will be the New Revolution, I hope. Power taken by those that create it in the first place. Not fat slovenly foxes seeking dominion and lust fulfillment. IMHO anyway.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, Welch is right, but for reasons that he wasn't aware of. The Singularity's coming on stronger than China and India.
              <br>
              <br>
              How Freudian :-) The Singularity is neither a given nor necessarily a good thing in any event. China and India are hopefully our partners and human brothers, and I dare say, in the overall scheme of things, Singularity be damned if
              this is not so. You must be a friend of Sharon Stone.

            <p class="mindxquote"> Dear Sally, I will be more than glad to explain why you think the way you do. Chiefly, because it is your beliefs, not reason or logic that drove you to respond as you did.
              <br>
              <br>
              So that YOU may understand better my position, Sally, I am the ultimate capitalist. You want Gold? Oil? Military Hardware? A small country? What? (Just a little inside joke). I am a realist with the curse of a conscience and
              intelligence. It is often a stumbling block in my quest for ever increasing profits and the dealings I must have with all manner of persons. Yet, I realize that money and power are what it takes to effect change. Indeed. I realize that
              my children and their children will have to live with the decisions I make, and the ones that you make. The ideals you seem to think are still alive in America are not here any more, and therefore, we are ALL in jeopardy. NO Empire
              last forever. Some are short lived and others undergo metamorphosis in order to keep the elite on top... The only constant is change. Why hate China or India? (It is evident in your fatherland undertones). Embrace them as mutual
              partners for progress in the right directions.
              <br>
              <br>
              To Wit:
              <br>
              <br>
              I stumbled upon Welch's essay when checking Kurzweil's site. It interested me. And I felt I had to respond to the ill-thought-out Marxists' responses to it. No moderator contacted me for comment.
              <br>
              <br>
              I'd like to point out a few facts first about Karl Marx:
              <br>
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              While I do not personally embrace communistic doctrine, I realize that the communism of today and the twisting of history have little to do with the tenets of Marxism. per se. Similarly, just as the Baptists are zealots and the
              Catholics are corrupt in ideology - each far and well removed from the original teachings of Jesus (for good example and balance) - so I say, is the modern communistic and Marxist dogma. If you read the link above and educated yourself
              a little, you would realize that there are many merits in his work and that the man was a brilliant and hard working man - hated because he railed against the rapidly dominating materialism based societies that were arising from
              unfettered and corrupted versions of capitalism. If you really want to know what capitalism is and where it comes from, read on:
              <br>
              <br>
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              While flawed in its own right, Marxism is not some evil in and of itself - it is an ideal for some, if only because it is counter to the extreme forms of capitalism that have caused a huge inequity in the world. Your liberal use of
              language in context is some evidence of your un-educated bias of all things intellectually stimulating - knowing both sides of the coin allow one to be balanced. THIS IS WHY I debate as I do - to counter the other extreme you have
              shown here - an extreme I see mainstream among those educated (= indoctrinated) in the current system of schools. It is readily apparent that you are thoroughly indoctrinated by the schools of Consumerism, and I must say it is obvious
              that you cannot but abhor anything counter to your programming.
              <br>
              <br>
              One could note that Karl Marx was greatly supported and funded by many so-called elite in the United States and that it was the USA corporations (names withheld) that backed the bloody revolution of the Bolsheviks in order to gain
              access to mining rights and other resources in Russia at the time. IT WAS CAPITALISM THAT GAVE COMMUNISM ITS BIRTH! Read a book other than the Agenda for A New American World Order, please. You might find out WHY EVERYONE mistrusts the
              government here - not you or I (The People), but the corrupt capitalist OWNERS of the former free Republic of America. I LOVE my country, yet I allow myself to THINK freely... this empowers me to contribute to THE PEOPLE, not the
              corporations.
              <br>
              <br>
              So, in summation, maybe only intellectuals can see all sides of the paradigm, Ma'am, and those self centered zealot prophets of evangelical, nationalistic capitalism cannot. They are through and through, products of system. Good for
              consumption and further propagation of like minded ilk. So that I am crystal clear on my perception of "it" - Capitalism itself is not evil, it is an advanced function of society, necessary to keep the interchange of commerce between
              entities flowing, however IT IS THE EASE by which the corrupt can take advantage of its flawed mechanism of organization and control that are dangerous! Note that there are indeed many forms of capitalism and the main thrust of MY
              argument is that the one here in the United States is critically flawed, biased in its service to the public good and obviously completely manipulated for gain by ONLY a select few at the detriment of The People at large - contrary to
              the ideals this country were founded on (FACT).
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              How many people on this thread actually read "The Singularity is Near" and Drexler's work on nanotechnology? How many thought through the startling implications on our lives? If they did, how could they bring such inane 19th century
              Marxist analysis to a very clearly 21st century advanced technology topic?
              <br>
              <br>
              Thought through the startling implications? This is hollow language. I can think through any fantasy I want, doesn't make it any more REAL. I have read and seen many things (including the above and deeper works on the subjects) and
              would caution against taking any ONE man's word for the future. NO ONE can predict the outcome of complex interactions, cause and effect that weave what we call the future. Yes, these technologies are being developed at a good clip,
              but there are factors OTHER that the technology itself, that make the eventual APPLICATION of that technology VIABLE. What you are asking us to do is look through a tube and ignore the peripheral reality of cause and effect. ECONOMICS
              and POLITICS have far more bearing on the eventual actualization of technology than the persons dreaming of and developing the technology do themselves! Here is a prime example: I know a group of engineers and assorted scientific
              leaders in their fields that have developed, ready for market, a satellite system capable of beaming energy directly to the Earth via laser beam at certain frequency. The technology is thoroughly trial tested and has been developed to
              a point where it can be used to power 4GW power plants in each array. You want to know the sad truth about American Capitalism and its so-called free market? They have to sell this power system to the Chinese because they are under
              threats (life and limb) against using this technology in America - the power kings here in the free market called America, control the APPLICATION of technology simply because profit and control is the MOST important thing - so, while
              you pay through the nose for energy and use polluting tech, keep in mind that AMERICAN capitalism PREVENTS the use of this technology! Whereas, in a "socialist" or "communist" capitalistic society, the demands of the people are first,
              not a few individuals.
              <br>
              <br>
              A small additional Off Topic caveat for you: Over "there", they execute people like Enron CEO's (GREAT POLICY!) and officials that are corrupt, WHEN that corruption costs the lives of the people or equally damaging. Hmmmm. All facts
              lady. Who's system is more progressive and protective of the whose society at large??? Is it getting clear?
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              How could they miss the fact that the self-organizing nature of American civilization meshes far better with accelerating change (actually spurs it on in many cases)in comparison to status quo environmentalism, outdated Marxist class
              consciousness, or stodgy tradition European thought?
              <br>
              <br>
              Enquiring minds want to know.
              <br>
              <br>
              None of this makes any sense - it is more empty language driven by an emotional mind. The self-organizing nature of American civilization - a fact? WOW! Are you for real? Self-organizing - every one is, even Russia, even an amoeba -
              don't use this fools language here. This is dumb dumb language used by politicians to fill empty heads with empty words (no meaning). Nature of American civilization??? What IS THAT? First, there is no one culture or "civilization" in
              America - it is a hodge-podge of competing cultures, most of which mistrust and even openly despise each other in increasing fervor! All that we have today, has been held together by a strict Anglo-Saxon code of governance and has only
              remained "stable" BECAUSE of the ruling elite being homogeneous Anglo-Saxon in culture!! FACT, whether you like it or not, politically correct or not - IT IS REALITY. This is rapidly giving way to a cold civil war now that the "other"
              competing ideologies of differing cultures have wealth within their ranks - this is a NEW phenomena and not calculated, obviously, by your great sage, Welch. The very same MISTAKE of the Roman empire has been repeated. You CANNOT
              maintain a functional Republic without perpetuating a singular doctrine of belief that UNITES the multitude of differing cultures within your borders, usually in the form of a religion, a common enemy, a moral code, an education system
              (there are many ways) - Currently here in America - giving them (other cultures) free reign IS THE PROBLEM! THEY DO NOT HAVE the interests of the "other" Americans at heart or even America itself. Watch rallies lately?? Any one?
              "Tolerance" being the idiots catch word and the fools errand. Living in peace and freely vetted as an individual means keeping your culture and your ideology OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE and TO YOURSELF - Tolerance for these competing
              cultures is the destruction of an Empire. Individual freedom of PRIVATE expression is the key. Not my philosophy, just read history. Without LOGICAL and CALCULATED, SINGULAR precepts of governance and culture, all things WILL collapse
              upon themselves - PROVEN by endless volumes of world history. You, apparently are part of that experiment, whereas consumerism is the defining cultural playing field that all groups will interact on here in America. HA ha ha. This is
              the funniest thing ever, since great in-equality exists within the State and without - eventual rebellion will result. Especially soon when people can't buy food here... get it yet? American consumerism is a SICKNESS that infects the
              people with low intelligence, sloth, low self-esteem, short attention spans, un-disciplined behaviours and on and on and on - EVIDENCE? Watch the local news in (insert your home city). Obtuse if you think THIS works. It MAY APPEAR to
              work better than other systems, and it may indeed, which is a poor testament to mans achievements, but it is still DEEPLY flawed and destructive to man kind in general - it is amoral and wrought with every selfish vice known.
              <br>
              <br>
              How you compare this to other forms of governance is one thing, but keep this in mind - CONSUMERISM knows no nationality and neither do the corporations running this country!! The very same corporations that are training our kids in
              school, starting wars for profit and making you eat the sh*t food we find on the shelves of our "free" country. The "America" corporations care NOTHING or America or its People. Are you really that brainwashed? I'd suggest getting the
              McFAt burger out of your mouth for starters since it is scientifically proven to screw up your body, and therefore your mind. Courtesy of American capitalism. Poison food. Lead toys (YES - AMERICAN company, outsourcing in China - blame
              the Chinese though, right?). War machine. MINDLESS TV selling sh*t to American kids. GREAT system indeed. Better than a dictatorship? Of course. Better than a Socialist state where NO ONE goes hungry or dies from lack of medical care -
              or even a poor, backwards country where people live off the land? You be the judge. I think that here we must look at the GOOD in EACH system, whether Marxist or Capitalist and use the ELEMENTS that are beneficially in EACH and
              eliminate the destructive forces. You would rather we embrace the one-sided??
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              The Marxists posting on this thread may disdain American capitalism and American politics, but they should remember a few facts:
              <br>
              <br>
              I don't think any one here is a Marxist, although from my post above, you may feel so inclined... You're just an uber-nationalist and from your tone, would probably welcome fascism as long as it was "American" in brand - it's obvious
              to the one with eye open.
              <br>
              <br>
              As to how any one CAN NOT disdain American politics is beyond me. American politics is the reason why the country is failing the grade (literally). The Founding Fathers (Masons I will add, not religious fools) did NOT envision a
              country run by political families, but by free men bound to public service when the NEED arose, not as a means of graft and lifestyle! It is SURELY UN-American, what is now called "American Politics". YOU should remember a few facts,
              like American history - the one they don't teach in school any more.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              1. American capitalism is by far the most productive and creative in the world. Check any list of comparative GDPs.
              <br>
              <br>
              Bullsh*t. GDP's are NOT a measure of anything worthwhile lady!! What if my GDP was higher than yours, but I had to kill a million civilians to do it and destroy an entire eco-system to accomplish it? IDIOT. Productive? DESTRUCTIVE,
              INVASIVE are better words describing the actual net result. Yeah, you got a fancy wardrobe, but the kids who stitched it together are slaves, where once they were farmers and free people - they country where it is produced reduced to
              environmental ruin for you. Consumerism destroyed their culture so you can have a coffee maker. THIS IS PROGRESS? Creativity? YOU are an unworldly person and so narrow in mind that you only see what you WANT to see. There is a PRICE
              for everything and I, for one, am not willing to accept the destruction of one man for the gain of another. America's wealth (and the wealth of MANY OTHER nations TOO) is built on WAR and destruction of entire races of people, cultures
              and ways of living - in the name of progress (i.e.; a bigger luxury for you). THIS is the GREAT IN-EQUALITY I keep referring to and the chief catalyst for our current state of affairs globally. Does it look pretty to you? Oh - they
              must be terrorists or rebels or Marxists or communists or just plain dumb native folks, huh?! Same lingo, different times. Just words make it easy for you to justify your destruction of peoples, environment and liberty. "THEY" are
              f*cking people, lady. Your brand of consumerism is their death. Remember that fact. Oh - and I can back mine up with historical references all day long - we'll start with the first White settlers that landed in the New World...
              progress indeed.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              2. American capitalism has been so since 1870 (5 years after the bloody and destructive Civil War!) when it officially surpassed Great Britain, a sure sign of long-term durability and competitive zest.
              <br>
              <br>
              What? The CAUSE of the civil war WAS exactly so:
              <br>
              <br>
              Northern industry that controlled politics in the North wanted total control over the Southern production - the Southerners were selling and trading with England at much better terms than the Northern business men!! So, in order to
              destroy the South's ability to remain sovereign economically and to capture the production capability of the South for PURE PROFIT for ONLY THE Northern Business Men - they orchestrated the civil war. I can go on and give details,
              facts and figures (but I tire) including the fact that Abraham Lincoln himself, in a letter to his wife, admitted that the slavery issue was a ruse and that HE HIMSELF did not see the Black Man as equal to White! Wonder why the US
              Penny looks the way it does, head left, color dark??? Hero to WHOM? But in order to "unify" the country, the Slavery issue was brought to the forefront so that the English subjects would rise in popular opposition to the British
              military support of the South. The entire political premise was a fake out. On top of that, Abraham Lincoln and his puppeteers destroyed the sovereignty of the States and helped create the unbalanced power of the Federal government we
              have now in clear violation of the original intents of this country! Here is a definition of fascism for your info: "Various scholars attribute different characteristics to fascism, but the following elements are usually seen as its
              integral parts: patriotism, nationalism, statism, militarism, totalitarianism, anti-communism, economic planning (including corporatism and autarky), populism, collectivism, autocracy and anti-liberalism (i.e., opposition to political
              and economic liberalism)." Are you paying attention now? Or still in denial? Probably a sympathizer...
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              3. American capitalism is legalized and protected by a proven, long-term, stable, durable Democratic Republic, better known as the United States of America. India and China should wish for such competence.
              <br>
              <br>
              What does this drivel mean, really? Legalized? ANYONE can legalize anything. Protected? (Means we will blow up your country if you don't give us your "insert enemy's resource here") Look at Africa for evidence. Long term, stable
              Democratic Republic??? China and India should learn...?? Lady, I'm an American through and through, but not an idiot, I recognize my own weaknesses and my faults. China has been around as a country WAY longer than ANY Western
              civilization, including the Roman Empire. Are you kidding me? India too, although India is a screwed up country all around due to total corruption (mob democracy at work). China, on the other hand is STILL the Han Dynasty. The
              communist revolution was a RETURN of the Dynasty, chasing out the foreigners that were exploiting the indigenous Chinese masses!! Who do you think the Taiwanese are?! Manchus. A situation where 10% ruled 90% and slaved them all in a
              highly capitalistic society, no less. The Mao revolution was not about communism, but about returning power to the people - the ideals of communism made it easier for Mao to unify under a single doctrine, that's all. America, on the
              other hand, is a child nation, newly birthed compared to... EVERYONE ELSE (except the new puppet governments we are popping up all over the place). You really need a history lesson. Competence? We are losing the resource war to China.
              We are losing the ONLY war that will declare a winner. Competence? Better check yourself before you wreck yourself on that one. This is survival, not games or semantical language describing a form of government! R-E-A-L-I-T-Y.
              <br>
              <br>
              Let it be known that as an American soldier, business man and scholar, I recognize this as a country founded on Masonic principles of logic and reason, equality of life and a recognition of the grand architect of life. I seek free and
              open discourse and un-inhibited travel between nations, the erasing of borders and ideas to each sovereign nation in the name of liberty and duty for ALL peoples on earth - not the elite corporations of America, China and Europe that
              keep us divided by using the tools of false commerce and consumerism. Be warned that the religious and nationalistic forces that infest our country and its politics and business are the DEATH of our great experiment - watch for them,
              they are manipulative and clever (different from intelligent). They are the lowest of low. Great dividers and pundits of mechanical progress at the cost of humanity.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              4. America is by far the LEAST polluting of ANY of the great industrialized countries in the world. Read the recent Smithsonian magazine's horror story about the Ganges River for disgusting details on genuine pollution.
              <br>
              <br>
              NOT TRUE AT ALL. China and India, yes, for sure. Call them on trying to play catch up so we that they don't get taken over by the American Corporations. Can you blame them? No. Besides, it's YOUR consumption causing this. As for Europe
              - most have their act together and are LIGHT YEARS ahead of us in clean living. All day long. Get your facts right and read something NOT printed in the USA for less "spin".
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              5. American culture truly values entrepreneurial inventiveness on the part of INDIVIDUALS. Ask the Marxists on this thread how much they value individualism. Not much, I'd wager.
              <br>
              <br>
              Not really true any more. In the past, individuals could create and bring to market with relative ease in America, but now you can get killed, black-balled and just plain crushed if your technology takes away profit from those already
              running the show. FACT. I just gave you one real life example at the beginning of this post concerning abundant, clean and "liberating" energy - problem is, it gives too much, too soon, to the People. xxxxxx Power can't have that, now
              can they? Gotta increase the bottom line like all good corporations do.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              And now, to make a point that may only seem to you to be off topic. IF (and I mean IF) China and India, the EU and Brazil, and any other contenders begin to approach American economic mastery, WILL it be too late for them, in terms of
              geopolitical balance of power concerns...IF the Singularity is also approaching, and perhaps happens?
              <br>
              <br>
              You are a wishful dreamer living in a Utopian fascist fantasy. It is all clear in your use of the English language. Every word filled with contempt for all "non" American peoples and countries. Your like-minded ilk are why we cannot
              live in peace with anyone. A reason WHY American Economic Mastery exists in the first place - un-equal distribution of wealth versus un-equal effort on the part of those laboring to bring the fruits to market. It is a diabolical
              paradigm based on a War Machine economy that sucks the life blood from its citizens, and where bankers steal and siphon the individual wealth of all free Americans of all creeds, races and positions in society. While I personally
              appreciate wealth and realize it as the right of anyone capable of developing their personal wealth - However, NOT on the BACKS of others without fair trade of value for labor received - which is the MAIN reason WHY so many super rich
              live in America. On the backs of people barely more than slaves - producing our goods, cleaning our messes and doing our dirty work. Hence the immigration issue! It is now, surely a class system, fool, and hence the coming civil war of
              cultures in America.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              I'll answer my own question with Ray Kurzweil's own prognostications: According to his analysis of Moore's Law and other trends, the Singularity is due sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. There is no way in Aitch Eeee Double Hockey Sticks
              that ANY nation could make a serious move on the American lead in that comparatively short amount of time.
              <br>
              <br>
              Although I respect his vision as powerfully sharp and his analysis of future trends as promising, Ray is not God, so I'll skip the Hail Ray to prognostication. Moore's law is already bunk (proven false) and so, I am sure, are many of
              your "trends". Where have you been?
              <br>
              <br>
              This is not about anyone "making moves" on America. It is about survival, in case you didn't notice. The race you see towards progress and prosperity is one that each nation runs - they run it to keep their respective populations fed,
              clothed, educated and content, just like us Americans here at home. Your language seems to reflect a position that America should be the only one entitled to power and position of prestige... We need to have a ONE world view in order
              for mankind to survive and prosper. The Singularity, if realized in the current political state of affairs will be a great tool of destruction and evil. The geo-political reality is that mostly selfish and self-serving men rule the
              earth today and any power of this magnitude should be kept far away from any nation, including the USA. Until the developers of this technology realize this and use this AI to seize power for themselves, I feel it prudent NOT to wish
              for Singularity and its predecessors. While human nature requires always an elite to rule and sell the ideals of civilization as they see it, I believe only a scientist elite would be best for mankind, not a political or corporate one
              (for now at least until the next "leap"). This will be the New Revolution, I hope. Power taken by those that create it in the first place. Not fat slovenly foxes seeking dominion and lust fulfillment. IMHO anyway.
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, Welch is right, but for reasons that he wasn't aware of. The Singularity's coming on stronger than China and India.
              <br>
              <br>
              How Freudian :-) The Singularity is neither a given nor necessarily a good thing in any event. China and India are hopefully our partners and human brothers, and I dare say, in the overall scheme of things, Singularity be damned if
              this is not so. You must be a friend of Sharon Stone.

        <p>&gt;One could note that Karl Marx was greatly supported and funded by many so-called elite in the United States and that it was the USA corporations (names withheld) that backed the bloody revolution of the Bolsheviks in order to gain
          access to mining rights and other resources in Russia at the time.
          <br>
          <br>
          US capitalists, such as Rockefeller, also backed the Nazis. See WORLD WITHOUT CANCER to find out how and why they did it and how they have managed to have their names and this history erased from the public school and higher "education"
          systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;IT WAS CAPITALISM THAT GAVE COMMUNISM ITS BIRTH!
          <br>
          <br>
          And don't forget, the leading lights of Communism were all Jewish. This looks bad, as similar leading lights are currently dominating the movie industry and the US banking industry. So intent to keep these facts sub rosa are apologists,
          the standard MO of their little sentinels is to tropistically label me anti-Semitic for even mentioning it.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;They are through and through, products of system.
          <br>
          <br>
          The corporate media indoctrinating system, not to mention the public school system.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Good for consumption and further propagation of like minded ilk.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;So that I am crystal clear on my perception of "it" - Capitalism itself is not evil,
          <br>
          <br>
          True. FREE MARKET capitalism where the gov isn't interfering AND the corporate plutocrats aren't in there twisting the wheels of gov for all manner of privileges and legal favors. Fed is perfect example of banking corporation in bed with
          Feds big time - cartel, no different than OPEC. Result = perverted capitalistic banking sys that's destroying the dollar.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;it is an advanced function of society, necessary to keep the interchange of commerce between entities flowing, however IT IS THE EASE by which the corrupt can take advantage of its flawed mechanism of organization and control that are
          dangerous!
          <br>
          <br>
          That's right. And one of the ways they do it by INFILTRATING the Congress with MONEY.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; Note that there are indeed many forms of capitalism
          <br>
          <br>
          True. Here are a some:
          <br>
          <br>
          FREE MARKET CAPITALISM
          <br>
          MONOPOLISTIC CAPITALISM
          <br>
          UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM
          <br>
          AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;and the main thrust of MY argument is that the one here in the United States is critically flawed, biased in its service to the public good and obviously completely manipulated for gain by ONLY a select few at the detriment of The
          People at large - contrary to the ideals this country were founded on (FACT).
          <br>
          <br>
          Absolutely.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;ECONOMICS and POLITICS have far more bearing on the eventual actualization of technology than the persons dreaming of and developing the technology do themselves!
          <br>
          <br>
          True. Some little peckers here at MIND-X have argued with their little brains that discussion of economics and politics as applied to technology are OFF TOPIC.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Here is a prime example: I know a group of engineers and assorted scientific leaders in their fields that have developed, ready for market, a satellite system capable of beaming energy directly to the Earth via laser beam at certain
          frequency. The technology is thoroughly trial tested and has been developed to a point where it can be used to power 4GW power plants in each array. You want to know the sad truth about American Capitalism and its so-called free market?
          They have to sell this power system to the Chinese because they are under threats (life and limb) against using this technology in America - the power kings here in the free market called America, control the APPLICATION of technology
          simply because profit and control is the MOST important thing - so, while you pay through the nose for energy and use polluting tech, keep in mind that AMERICAN capitalism PREVENTS the use of this technology!
          <br>
          <br>
          That's right. The plutocrats that have hijacked the Congress use the police powers of the state to ram through their fascist agenda of selective exploitation and suppression of innovative competition.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Whereas, in a "socialist" or "communist" capitalistic society, the demands of the people are first, not a few individuals.
          <br>
          <br>
          Well this may be taking it a little too far. The ruling elite in these "societies" have usually gone COMPLETELY hog-wild, to the point where they mass murder on a scale of Stalin. See a screenplay I developed (and all studios in Hollywood
          passed on) at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.mecfilms.com/dna/indev/features/splash.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mecfilms.com/dna/indev/features/splash. htm</a> It's based on a true story.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;A small additional Off Topic caveat for you: Over "there", they execute people like Enron CEO's (GREAT POLICY!) and officials that are corrupt, WHEN that corruption costs the lives of the people or equally damaging.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hey, it would be great if we could execute a few corporate pigs and some treasonous congressmen, but then we would be no different than the soviet and communist pigs. Their "systems" are even WORSE than unbridled capitalism and monopoly
          capitalism.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Hmmmm. All facts lady. Who's system is more progressive and protective of the whose society at large??? Is it getting clear?
          <br>
          <br>
          No, here you are getting a little foggy. But I can appreciate your passion. :)
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;First, there is no one culture or "civilization" in America - it is a hodge-podge of competing cultures, most of which mistrust and even openly despise each other in increasing fervor!
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes, thanks to the Immigration Act of 1965 and the Hollywood-based US motion picture industry under cultural Marxist influence.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;All that we have today, has been held together by a strict Anglo-Saxon code of governance and has only remained "stable" BECAUSE of the ruling elite being homogeneous Anglo-Saxon in culture!!
          <br>
          <br>
          True. In short, what's left of the US Constitution and Judeo-Christian values.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;FACT, whether you like it or not, politically correct or not - IT IS REALITY. This is rapidly giving way to a cold civil war now that the "other" competing ideologies of differing cultures have wealth within their ranks - this is a NEW
          phenomena and not calculated, obviously, by your great sage, Welch.
          <br>
          <br>
          You can thank Hollywood. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM/bginfo.htm" target="_blank">http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM/bginfo.htm</a> for the largest repository of info on the Net on this
          subject.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The very same MISTAKE of the Roman empire has been repeated. You CANNOT maintain a functional Republic without perpetuating a singular doctrine of belief that UNITES the multitude of differing cultures within your borders, usually in
          the form of a religion, a common enemy, a moral code, an education system (there are many ways)
          <br>
          <br>
          A Constitution.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;- Currently here in America - giving them (other cultures) free reign IS THE PROBLEM!
          <br>
          <br>
          True. But again thank...
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; THEY DO NOT HAVE the interests of the "other" Americans at heart or even America itself. Watch rallies lately?? Any one? "Tolerance" being the idiots catch word and the fools errand.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's right, this word "tolerance" is being promulgated mostly by Jewish studio executives that don't want a repeat of the Holocaust thus they want "tolerance" for Jews but instead of being honest about it, they couch it in terms for all
          other ethnic groups.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Living in peace and freely vetted as an individual means keeping your culture and your ideology OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE and TO YOURSELF - Tolerance for these competing cultures is the destruction of an Empire.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. The move to make SPANISH a second language is preposterous for anyone who wants to maintain a unified country. America is NOT a "multicultural nation" as the MPAA propagandists are trying to make it.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;American consumerism is a SICKNESS that infects the people with low intelligence, sloth, low self-esteem, short attention spans, un-disciplined behaviours and on and on and on -
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; EVIDENCE? Watch the local news in (insert your home city). Obtuse if you think THIS works. It MAY APPEAR to work better than other systems, and it may indeed, which is a poor testament to mans achievements, but it is still DEEPLY
          flawed and destructive to man kind in general - it is amoral and wrought with every selfish vice known.
          <br>
          <br>
          BUT, it can improve if we get back to first principles and get rid of the plutocrats that have hijacked the Congress.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;How you compare this to other forms of governance is one thing, but keep this in mind - CONSUMERISM knows no nationality and neither do the corporations running this country!!
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The very same corporations that are training our kids in school, starting wars for profit and making you eat the sh*t food we find on the shelves of our "free" country.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The "America" corporations care NOTHING or America or its People.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Are you really that brainwashed? I'd suggest getting the McFAt burger out of your mouth for starters since it is scientifically proven to screw up your body, and therefore your mind.
          <br>
          <br>
          Right. This shit they call food in the country is pathetic. The US needs to declare its food supply TOXIC and start over from there.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; Courtesy of American capitalism. Poison food.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's right. These corporations care nothing for people or the quality of the slop they package. They just care about PROFIT and STOCKHOLDER VALUE. They put monosodium gluconate in the food and hydrogenated oil just to give the crap
          longer shelf life so they can SELL more. This is the MONEY MENTALITY at work.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Lead toys (YES - AMERICAN company, outsourcing in China - blame the Chinese though, right?).
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes, as if this were where the big focus should be. But that said, who knows what kind of quality "assurance" they have in China.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;War machine.
          <br>
          <br>
          $550 billion a year. 700 military bases all over planet. 130 countries. Sheesh! Almost all financed with FIAT MONEY.

          &gt; MINDLESS TV selling sh*t to American kids.

          Thank the following specific people in Hollywood:
          <br>

          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;GREAT system indeed.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes. WAS a great sys -- before the BabyBoomers got a hold of it and pissed their used beer all over it.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; Better than a dictatorship? Of course. Better than a Socialist state where NO ONE goes hungry or dies from lack of medical care - or even a poor, backwards country where people live off the land? You be the judge.
          <br>
          <br>
          In communist state gov owns the means of production. In socialist state gov just TAKES the fruits of production through excessive taxation. In monopoly capitalist state, plutocracy and gov team up to exploit the people. All three states
          suck.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;I think that here we must look at the GOOD in EACH system, whether Marxist or Capitalist and use the ELEMENTS that are beneficially in EACH and eliminate the destructive forces. You would rather we embrace the one-sided??
          <br>
          <br>
          True. Out of all these broken and crappy systems maybe there are elements of each that could be recycled into a better system. This is a worthy goal.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;I don't think any one here is a Marxist,
          <br>
          <br>
          Probably not, BUT most here are CULTURAL Marxists, or cultural Marxist-influenced, without even realizing it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;As to how any one CAN NOT disdain American politics is beyond me.
          <br>
          <br>
          As long as we have the RepubliCrats.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;American politics is the reason why the country is failing the grade (literally).
          <br>
          <br>
          True. Starting in 1913.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The Founding Fathers (Masons I will add, not religious fools) did NOT envision a country run by political families,
          <br>
          <br>
          Right. I'm sick of BUSHES and CLINTONS.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;but by free men bound to public service when the NEED arose, not as a means of graft and lifestyle! It is SURELY UN-American, what is now called "American Politics". YOU should remember a few facts, like American history - the one they
          don't teach in school any more.
          <br>
          <br>
          Right.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Bullsh*t. GDP's are NOT a measure of anything worthwhile lady!! What if my GDP was higher than yours, but I had to kill a million civilians to do it and destroy an entire eco-system to accomplish it? IDIOT. Productive? DESTRUCTIVE,
          INVASIVE are better words describing the actual net result.
          <br>
          <br>
          Good point. I might add that GDP also incorporates all the negative products such as bombs and externalized pollution.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Yeah, you got a fancy wardrobe, but the kids who stitched it together are slaves, where once they were farmers and free people - they country where it is produced reduced to environmental ruin for you.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. Many of them are slave. Some of them are getting improved lives however. I don't know where the line is drawn.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Consumerism destroyed their culture so you can have a coffee maker. THIS IS PROGRESS? Creativity? YOU are an unworldly person and so narrow in mind that you only see what you WANT to see. There is a PRICE for everything and I, for one,
          am not willing to accept the destruction of one man for the gain of another. America's wealth (and the wealth of MANY OTHER nations TOO) is built on WAR and destruction of entire races of people, cultures and ways of living - in the name
          of progress (i.e.; a bigger luxury for you). THIS is the GREAT IN-EQUALITY I keep referring to and the chief catalyst for our current state of affairs globally. Does it look pretty to you? Oh - they must be terrorists or rebels or Marxists
          or communists or just plain dumb native folks, huh?! Same lingo, different times. Just words make it easy for you to justify your destruction of peoples, environment and liberty. "THEY" are f*cking people, lady. Your brand of consumerism
          is their death. Remember that fact. Oh - and I can back mine up with historical references all day long - we'll start with the first White settlers that landed in the New World... progress indeed.
          <br>
          <br>
          Some good points. Some stuff I don't know about.
          <br>
          &gt;America, on the other hand, is a child nation, newly birthed compared to... EVERYONE ELSE (except the new puppet governments we are popping up all over the place). You really need a history lesson. Competence? We are losing the
          resource war to China. We are losing the ONLY war that will declare a winner. Competence? Better check yourself before you wreck yourself on that one. This is survival, not games or semantical language describing a form of government!
          R-E-A-L-I-T-Y.
          <br>
          <br>
          A lot of this you can blame on the WTO, NAFTA and GATT.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Let it be known that as an American soldier, business man and scholar, I recognize this as a country founded on Masonic principles
          <br>
          <br>
          My grandfather was a Mason and my father-in-law is a Mason. I was a Scientologist and a BabyBoomer :)
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;of logic and reason, equality of life and a recognition of the grand architect of life.
          <br>
          <br>
          What they often called Providence.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;I seek free and open discourse and un-inhibited travel between nations, the erasing of borders and ideas to each sovereign nation in the name of liberty and duty for ALL peoples on earth -
          <br>
          <br>
          Be careful, or you will end up with loss of national sovereignty, if Canada and Mexico merge with the US. The mergers will try to pull the US into their world organizations, the very orgs that are causing much of what you disdain. What
          needs to happen is the US needs to EXPAND into these countries and BRING them in UNDER the US Constitution -- if they want that.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;not the elite corporations of America, China and Europe that keep us divided by using the tools of false commerce and consumerism. Be warned that the religious and nationalistic forces that infest our country and its politics and
          business are the DEATH of our great experiment - watch for them, they are manipulative and clever (different from intelligent). They are the lowest of low. Great dividers and pundits of mechanical progress at the cost of humanity.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          ??
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Besides, it's YOUR consumption causing this.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. China wouldn't be polluting as much if there was not so much US consumerism.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;As for Europe - most have their act together and are LIGHT YEARS ahead of us in clean living. All day long. Get your facts right and read something NOT printed in the USA for less "spin".
          <br>
          <br>
          Right. The us media is basically a lie.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Not really true any more. In the past, individuals could create and bring to market with relative ease in America, but now you can get killed, black-balled and just plain crushed if your technology takes away profit from those already
          running the show.
          <br>
          <br>
          True. And you don't even have to be Nikola Tesla for this to happen.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;FACT. I just gave you one real life example at the beginning of this post concerning abundant, clean and "liberating" energy - problem is, it gives too much, too soon, to the People. xxxxxx Power can't have that, now can they? Gotta
          increase the bottom line like all good corporations do.
          <br>
          <br>
          Right.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;You are a wishful dreamer living in a Utopian fascist fantasy. It is all clear in your use of the English language. Every word filled with contempt for all "non" American peoples and countries. Your like-minded ilk are why we cannot
          live in peace with anyone. A reason WHY American Economic Mastery exists in the first place - un-equal distribution of wealth versus un-equal effort on the part of those laboring to bring the fruits to market. It is a diabolical paradigm
          based on a War Machine economy that sucks the life blood from its citizens, and where bankers steal and siphon the individual wealth of all free Americans of all creeds, races and positions in society. While I personally appreciate wealth
          and realize it as the right of anyone capable of developing their personal wealth - However, NOT on the BACKS of others without fair trade of value for labor received - which is the MAIN reason WHY so many super rich live in America. On
          the backs of people barely more than slaves - producing our goods, cleaning our messes and doing our dirty work. Hence the immigration issue! It is now, surely a class system, fool, and hence the coming civil war of cultures in America.
          <br>
          <br>
          Well said.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Although I respect his vision as powerfully sharp and his analysis of future trends as promising, Ray is not God, so I'll skip the Hail Ray to prognostication. Moore's law is already bunk (proven false)
          <br>
          <br>
          How so?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;and so, I am sure, are many of your "trends". Where have you been?
          <br>
          <br>
          Maybe not. Have you read THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;This is not about anyone "making moves" on America. It is about survival, in case you didn't notice. The race you see towards progress and prosperity is one that each nation runs - they run it to keep their respective populations fed,
          clothed, educated and content, just like us Americans here at home. Your language seems to reflect a position that America should be the only one entitled to power and position of prestige...
          <br>
          <br>
          I didn't really get that Sally was saying that M.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt; We need to have a ONE world view in order for mankind to survive and prosper.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have no idea what that would be. Do you?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The Singularity, if realized in the current political state of affairs will be a great tool of destruction and evil.
          <br>
          <br>
          Possibly not. The Singularity, if SAI, might be logical and ethical and thus eradicate all the greedy plutocrats like lice. A twist in the plot.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;The geo-political reality is that mostly selfish and self-serving men rule the earth today and any power of this magnitude should be kept far away from any nation, including the USA. Until the developers of this technology realize this
          and use this AI to seize power for themselves, I feel it prudent NOT to wish for Singularity and its predecessors.
          <br>
          <br>
          I have said many times here, you programmers out there, watch out who or what you are programming for. Don't be tools of these corporate madmen running the world war machine.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;While human nature requires always an elite to rule and sell the ideals of civilization as they see it, I believe only a scientist elite would be best for mankind,
          <br>
          <br>
          I agree wholeheartedly. Right now the people in Congress are unfit to govern or represent. What do LAWYERS know about ANYTHING, yet Congress is filled with this putrid scum.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;not a political or corporate one (for now at least until the next "leap"). This will be the New Revolution, I hope. Power taken by those that create it in the first place. Not fat slovenly foxes seeking dominion and lust fulfillment.
          IMHO anyway.
          <br>
          <br>
          I agree. The people that currently have power need to placed into forced retirement.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;How Freudian :-) The Singularity is neither a given nor necessarily a good thing in any event.
          <br>
          <br>
          True.
          <br>

            <p class="mindxquote"> The Marxists posting on this thread may disdain American capitalism and American politics, but they should remember a few facts:
              <br>
              <br>
              1. American capitalism is by far the most productive and creative in the world. Check any list of comparative GDPs.
              <br>
              <br>
              2. American capitalism has been so since 1870 (5 years after the bloody and destructive Civil War!) when it officially surpassed Great Britain, a sure sign of long-term durability and competitive zest.
              <br>
              <br>
              3. American capitalism is legalized and protected by a proven, long-term, stable, durable Democratic Republic, better known as the United States of America. India and China should wish for such competence.
              <br>
              <br>
              4. America is by far the LEAST polluting of ANY of the great industrialized countries in the world. Read the recent Smithsonian magazine's horror story about the Ganges River for disgusting details on genuine pollution.
              <br>
              <br>
              5. American culture truly values entrepreneurial inventiveness on the part of INDIVIDUALS. Ask the Marxists on this thread how much they value individualism. Not much, I'd wager.
              <br>
              <br>
              And now, to make a point that may only seem to you to be off topic. IF (and I mean IF) China and India, the EU and Brazil, and any other contenders begin to approach American economic mastery, WILL it be too late for them, in terms of
              geopolitical balance of power concerns...IF the Singularity is also approaching, and perhaps happens?
              <br>
              <br>
              I'll answer my own question with Ray Kurzweil's own prognostications: According to his analysis of Moore's Law and other trends, the Singularity is due sometime in the 2030s or 2040s. There is no way in Aitch Eeee Double Hockey Sticks
              that ANY nation could make a serious move on the American lead in that comparatively short amount of time.
              <br>
              <br>
              In short, Welch is right, but for reasons that he wasn't aware of. The Singularity's coming on stronger than China and India. </p>
          </center>
          <br>
          <br>
          Much of this is positive or true Sally, but the problem is we don't HAVE American CAPITALISM in the country any longer. What we now have is a form of corporate fascism, more properly known as UNBRIDLED CAPITALISM or MONOPOLISTIC
          CAPITALISM.
          <br>
          <br>
          We also have a CARTEL, known as the Federal Reserve System, running the banking system. This system creates unconstitutional fiat money that has allowed the military-industrial complex and the multinational corporations to run wild -- not
          to mention endless wars and growths like Bush and McCain to emerge.
          <br>
          <br>
          IF these entities were to be reigned in and placed under Constitutional Law and the US Empire were to return to sound money and a government that focused on PROTECTING not PROVIDING, we would have a lassie fair capitalist system that would
          be all you describe.
          <br>
          <br>
          But this system will not happen until and unless Congress is flushed and the Fed is abolished -- to start. Then most of/all of Ron Paul's advice needs to be applied. The Dems and GOP are abortions. These parties need to be abolished ASAP
          and all the sheep and sycophants that populate them re-educated in Constitution 101.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also Hollywood needs to be reformed or abandoned. This means kicking out all the cultural Marxist-dominating worms that currently infest it. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM" target="_blank">http://www.homevideo.net/FIRM</a>

        <p>James,
          <br>
          <br>
          Sounds like you're talking to yourself a lot here. I read messages from James Jaeger TO James Jaeger in above posts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Get that solipsism thing of yours fixed.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the meantime, some thoughts on your various selves' thoughts:
          <br>
          <br>
          I am very well educated on the nature of free societies. For one thing, I am a Hayekian. Try reading his magnum opus, The Road to Serfdom. See if it doesn't free your mind from your statist views.
          <br>
          <br>
          Plutocrats do not run America, although some are trying mightily to buy our political system. See George Soros and follow the money.
          <br>
          <br>
          Your little zinger about the Jews running the Soviet Union is a laugher. Find out how much the Soviets really "loved" the Jews. Read Ferguson's The War of the World for a very stomach churning overview of pre-war and war-time in Europe. If
          you do, you won't so blithely dismiss my positive commentary on the nature of American society again.
          <br>
          <br>
          You mistook my comment on the sickening pollution of the Ganges. This occurred due to the LACK of high technology in India, not due to India's industrializing. The pollution in the Ganges is the result of a mostly agricultural economy.
          <br>
          <br>
          Marx was a hack. He believed in the Zero-Sum Society, even with all evidence against him. He believed in the Iron Law of Wages, while wages were rising rapidly in the West. He believed in the kind of simplified class conscience society
          that only a Medievalist could believe in. He believed in Historical Inevitability--another laugher. Once his acolytes started to move to America, they defected in droves when they realized the power of a truly free society.
          <br>
          <br>
          No American politician talks of self-organization. Very few (with the possible exception of Newt Gingrich) are knowledgeable enough about such processes and America's resulting technological creativity. I do not take any of my analysis
          from them, even the ones I agree with politically, simply because they have no such analysis.
          <br>
          <br>
          My analysis of self-organizing systems comes from the following authors (among many others): James Gleich, Mandelbrot, Prigogine, von Mises, Hayek, Leonard Read, Robert Wright, Isaiah Berlin, Hofstadter, Adam Smith, Robert Axelrod,
          Hernando de Soto, Madison, Tocqueville, Greg Bear, Poul Anderson, Stewart Guthrie, Louise Young, Jane Jacobs--and of course Eric Drexler and Ray Kurzweil. The synthesis of their thoughts is my own.
          <br>
          <br>
          A free society is utterly dependent on the good work of millions of people engaged in hundreds of thousands of different types of work, exchanging their work freely through the impersonal medium of the price system--in short, markets. This
          system is a distributive intelligence system. In other words, the burden of managing the enormous amount of dataflow in a 300 million-person, 13 trillion dollar economy is NOT centralized, but distributes itself throughout the economy. The
          genius of the system is that NO ONE RUNS IT. No bureaucrat, captain of industry, or even cabal of industrialist is smart enough to know but a tiny fraction of what the system AS system knows.
          <br>
          <br>
          Socialism, is by contrast, a very stupid system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Socialism is an attempt to free people of economic insecurity through centralization of all economic decision-making into the national government's planners hands. By so doing, all private spheres of individual decision-making are
          destroyed. By so doing, all "mere formal" freedoms of individuals are destroyed. By so doing, the free society they used to live in is destroyed. And by so doing, any ability to maintain the wealth producing capabilities of the former
          system is destroyed. The people not only lose their freedoms, but the economic security they traded them in for as well. As economic well-being becomes more and more dependent on whether you are a part of the salaried structure of
          government, and whether you have a chance at some jobs becomes more and more dependent on your connections and your "political dependability," the War of All Against All endemic in socialist societies grows fierce and much more deadly.
          <br>
          <br>
          You're right. I do not honor any system that promises to "feed the people and give them all health care." For the above reasons, such systems must fail at even the bare minimum goals they set for themselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          Congratulations on the interest a leftist web site has expressed in your writings. I'm sure you'll fit in with their conspiracy-theory mindedness easily.</p>

          of technology, development, in particular.

          I've never read Eric Fromm. He's on a long list of writers I'd like to get to One of These Days.

          <br>
          Escape from Freedom. There's no question that a lot of socialists and fellow travelers are that way because they do hate freedom. I suspect a lot more of them think they can have government run everything AND keep individual freedom.
          <br>
          <br>
          I hate to break it to 'em, but, no can do.</p>

        <p>I just Googled the Lifeboat Foundation. Sounds like a bunch of good guys, especially with Shermer on board. I bookmarked the site.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also checked Howard Bloom at that site and found out he wrote this book: "Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century" in 2000. I clicked the link to Amazon and got this description:
          <br>
          <br>
          "When did big-picture optimism become cool again? While not blind to potential problems and glitches, Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind From the Big Bang to the 21st Century confidently asserts that our networked culture is not only
          inevitable but essential for our species' survival and eventual migration into space. Author Howard Bloom, believed by many to be R. Buckminster Fuller's intellectual heir, takes the reader on a dizzying tour of the universe, from its
          original subatomic particle network to the unimaginable data-processing power of intergalactic communication. His writing is smart and snappy, moving with equal poise through depictions of frenzied bacteria passing along information
          packets in the form of DNA and nomadic African tribespeople putting their heads together to find water for the next year."
          <br>
          <br>
          From that and the rest of the descriptions, I take it he is very into the kind of self-organizing universal processes that I love.
          <br>

          Check out my group, which I call "The Grassroots Creation" at ScribD here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.scribd.com/groups/view/10505-the-grassroots-creation" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/groups/view/10505-the-grassr

          ScribD is a nice free site for publishing writings. You lay them out to your own liking on your own word processing program, then upload them to their site without any fuss. Their software translates your documents into iPaper docs
          automatically.
          <br>
          <br>
          Here's one of my essays: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.scribd.com/doc/3302001/Of-Robots-and-Empire-Asimov" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/3302001/Of-Robots-and-Em pire-Asimov</a>
          <br>
          in which I critique Isaac Asimov's Robots and Empire statist universe, making a number of arguments for self-organization processes thereby. An extra treat for libertarians: I use Leonard Read's classic essay on economics, "I, Pencil," in
          my analysis.

          &gt;I am very well educated on the nature of free societies. For one thing, I am a Hayekian. Try reading his magnum opus, The Road to Serfdom. See if it doesn't free your mind from your statist views.
          <br>
          <br>
          What do you mean, statist views?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Plutocrats do not run America, although some are trying mightily to buy our political system. See George Soros and follow the money.
          <br>
          <br>
          Well, sure, but what I mean is the lobbies that have Congress all tied up with campaign funds. My personal belief is that Congressmen should only represent flesh and blood PEOPLE not artificial entities like corporations. These congressmen
          have so many conflicts of interest going, it's no wonder the government gets little done.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Your little zinger about the Jews running the Soviet Union is a laugher.
          <br>
          <br>
          Straw argument Sally. I never said they run anything. I said Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, plus many of the Marxist of the Frankfurt School were Jewish. I have no problem with that, BUT Hollywood is trying to hide this fact. Why?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Find out how much the Soviets really "loved" the Jews.
          <br>
          <br>
          Well you're right on here. Ironically that screenplay we developed a number of years back, SPLASH OR RED, has as the main character a little Jewish boy and he works for Stalin. Stalin makes him wear a Christian cross. I asked Sasha if
          Stalin was anti-Semitic and he said not really. What do you think? This guy personally knew Stalin. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.mecfilms.com/dna/indev/features/splash.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mecfilms.com/dna/indev/features/splash.
            pdf</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Read Ferguson's The War of the World for a very stomach churning overview of pre-war and war-time in Europe. If you do, you won't so blithely dismiss my positive commentary on the nature of American society again.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks. I'll try and check it out.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;You mistook my comment on the sickening pollution of the Ganges. This occurred due to the LACK of high technology in India, not due to India's industrializing. The pollution in the Ganges is the result of a mostly agricultural economy.
          <br>
          <br>
          I see. I don't think I commented on that as I know nothing about that area.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Marx was a hack. He believed in the Zero-Sum Society, even with all evidence against him.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes, good point.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;He believed in the Iron Law of Wages, while wages were rising rapidly in the West. He believed in the kind of simplified class conscience society that only a Medievalist could believe in.
          <br>
          <br>
          Right.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;He believed in Historical Inevitability--another laugher. Once his acolytes started to move to America, they defected in droves when they realized the power of a truly free society.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes. I don't think you and I have any disagreements on Marxism and how it's negatively affected the US and world. My main point is that capitalism, the best system so far devised, CAN be abused and distorted.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;No American politician talks of self-organization. Very few (with the possible exception of Newt Gingrich) are knowledgeable enough about such processes and America's resulting technological creativity.
          <br>
          <br>
          I like much of what Newt says and feel he understands that we need to get back to Constitutional principles. I DO however feel he's an insider that's part of the problem.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;I do not take any of my analysis from them, even the ones I agree with politically, simply because they have no such analysis.
          <br>
          <br>
          I see.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;My analysis of self-organizing systems comes from the following authors (among many others): James Gleich, Mandelbrot, Prigogine, von Mises, Hayek, Leonard Read, Robert Wright, Isaiah Berlin, Hofstadter, Adam Smith, Robert Axelrod,
          Hernando de Soto, Madison, Tocqueville, Greg Bear, Poul Anderson, Stewart Guthrie, Louise Young, Jane Jacobs--and of course Eric Drexler and Ray Kurzweil. The synthesis of their thoughts is my own.
          <br>
          <br>
          I didn't comment on that. M did. So don't get pissed at me :)
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;A free society is utterly dependent on the good work of millions of people engaged in hundreds of thousands of different types of work, exchanging their work freely through the impersonal medium of the price system--in short, markets.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes. I think the problem comes when the gov interferes or when big business asks for special privileges.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;This system is a distributive intelligence system. In other words, the burden of managing the enormous amount of dataflow in a 300 million-person, 13 trillion dollar economy is NOT centralized, but distributes itself throughout the
          economy. The genius of the system is that NO ONE RUNS IT.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Except for the price of money. THIS is "run" by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee. So we have a semi-capitalist, distributed economy and a centralized, communist banking system, in effect.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;No bureaucrat, captain of industry, or even cabal of industrialist is smart enough to know but a tiny fraction of what the system AS system knows.
          <br>
          <br>
          So WHY should a bunch of bureaucrats be able to dictate the COST and AMOUNT of money, the one (1) commodity that REPRESENTS all other products and services. Inconsistent wouldn't you say?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Socialism, is by contrast, a very stupid system.
          <br>
          <br>
          Yes, it is. I doesn't require the gov own the MEANS of production (like Communism) but it does allow the gov to confiscate the FRUITS of production (through taxation and the hidden tax of inflation, caused by fiat money).
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Socialism is an attempt to free people of economic insecurity through centralization of all economic decision-making into the national government's planners hands. By so doing, all private spheres of individual decision-making are
          destroyed. By so doing, all "mere formal" freedoms of individuals are destroyed. By so doing, the free society they used to live in is destroyed. And by so doing, any ability to maintain the wealth producing capabilities of the former
          system is destroyed. The people not only lose their freedoms, but the economic security they traded them in for as well. As economic well-being becomes more and more dependent on whether you are a part of the salaried structure of
          government, and whether you have a chance at some jobs becomes more and more dependent on your connections and your "political dependability," the War of All Against All endemic in socialist societies grows fierce and much more deadly.
          <br>
          <br>
          You have no argument with me on this. Well stated.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;You're right. I do not honor any system that promises to "feed the people and give them all health care." For the above reasons, such systems must fail at even the bare minimum goals they set for themselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          And such a system can never create GENERAL WELFARE of the type envisioned by the Framers. Problem with the current society is this term GENRRAL WELFAIR has been interpreted to mean WELFARE IN GENERAL for all Americans ... which is
          socialism.
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;Congratulations on the interest a leftist web site has expressed in your writings.
          <br>
          <br>
          What site, what writings?
          <br>
          <br>
          &gt;I'm sure you'll fit in with their conspiracy-theory mindedness easily.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm a Libertarian. I hate the Dems AND the GOP. They're both vomit.
          <br>
          <br>
          Sally, if you have the time, watch my doc on the Federal Reserve, FIAT EMPIRE (free on Google Video c/o <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.fiatempire)/" target="_blank">http://www.FiatEmpire)</a> and check out
          all or part of the script for my current doc, ORIGINAL INTENT, at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621141756/http://www.fiatempire.com/producers" target="_blank">http://www.FiatEmpire.com/producers</a> Hopefully you will get a
          better view of my position on things. I don't think we're that far apart on the basics, except I think you might be more of a Republican than myself. On the other hand, although M wrote some passionate things and he was a little harsh with
          you, I think you and he also are on a similar page on more than might seem obvious at first glance. I think what M is disconcerted with this the monopoly capitalism we see hurting this nation these days. This is also my concern. You are
          right to disdain socialism and all forms of Marxism however, but I think one should also keep an eye on those that would abuse capitalism and democracy, the two most workable institutions devised to date. Just some thoughts. Thanks for
          yours, especially any you care to give on the documentaries.

          The development of technology, in the 21st century, will occur regardless of national boundaries. Therefore, it will no longer be important to be exactly someplace, to work on an evolving technology. With this in mind, here's how I see the
          world... it'll be a multipolar industrial world, with various govts forming trade/political alliances, however, for the most part, it'll be a alliances of large corporations, financial a/o industrial, straddling the planet with research
          and development happening on all corners. There won't be these clear lines which say that widget 'A' is researched in the US, designed in Canada, fabricated in Korea, but then manufactured, in bulk, in Indonesia. Elements of widget 'A' can
          be all over the place as vendors and suppliers will have rotating agreements and delivery dates for different subcomponents/subelements.

        <p>Yes, services and software will, in fact, be fully global. The rapid proliferation of open source tools is proof of that, in itself. On the other shoe, the actual synthesis of drugs or in this case, delivery agents, will need to be done
          in certain labs but I truly doubt that they'll be in the same academic ivory towers of today. If you look at the latter half of the 20th (and early) 21st century, places like Bell Labs have declined, in favor of a more decentralized
          R&amp;D organization. Still, a large company or conglomerate of companies, will have the heavy intellectual property which still means that up until "singularity", i.e. everyone having an assembler in the apartment, the model of highly
          multinational organizations will continue to exist but perhaps in a different manner than let's say a GE or Mitsubishi which don't really address the global organization, just hard walled corporate divisions.

        <p>Wow! The terminology - the semantics - so 20th century! American culture is incredibly ethnocentric, and despite our amazing gains in terms of recognizing the plurality of cultures within our own borders, we still have trouble with
          anybody outside of those borders.
          <br>
          <br>
          So are we REALLY going to ask who's going to rule the 21st Century? And if so, why's it have to be a culture, or a country? Why can't it be a plural mixture of hard-working, intellectually oriented people from many cultures, rather than a
          simple US vs. THEM example?
          <br>
          <br>
          After a LOT of hard-earned life experience, I've arrived at some simple inarguable conclusion about cultures, countries, perspectives, etc: People are people, regardless.
          <br>
          <br>
          Kennedy said it best, "For in the final analysis, our most basic common link, is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal."
          <br>
          <br>
          ..and that's a bottom line: Indian, Chinese, Russian, American: we all want the same things. Healthy children, food on the table, the opportunity to make a difference, and some way to make our mark.
          <br>
          <br>
          The hallmark of the 20th century was social-idealism: let's all get into groups, label ourselves, and then get into a war based on which label sounds better. Everybody lines up, gets their stamp, and grabs a rifle to defend their holy book
          against the guy next door.
          <br>
          <br>
          Those policies worked well enough to get us through 2 World Wars and a long-shot to the moon, but ultimately we have to grow up &amp; learn how to live with our neighbors - and it's not hard, since they basically want to live with us, too.
          <br>
          <br>
          Let's worry less about who's going to rule the 21st century, and spend more time solving basic social issues: overpopulation, disease, crime, etc. If we can do a better job here at home, then we're going to have a lot less free time to
          worry about how our neighbor across the way is doing at his place.

        <p>I have the image of a toilet bowl with all of us paddling around in it looking for answers. Lets for now, forget about he said, she said, and look at the BIG PICTURE:)
          <br>
          <br>
          1. We have a world moving into Chaos- this is a very good thing-(thank you Martha:)
          <br>
          <br>
          2. Any Observer will tell you that at the Quantum level when we have coherence the world runs in a smooth and orderly fashion. Omni particles become locked in a graviton grid.
          <br>
          <br>
          3. So how does change happen? A certain amount of energy must be applied to cause the omni to shift, a new paradigm shift. Can this happen through a shift in consciousness. In my mind yes- definitely yes-
          <br>
          <br>
          4. What does this look like- chaos and a collapse of what has been. This period marks the reorganization into the future new paradigm. How many folkies does it take to collapse a wave into a particle?
          <br>
          <br>
          5. The result of this is reformation into a new coherence.
          <br>
          <br>
          6. Maybe the Singularity is closer than we think:)
          <br>
          <br>
          It is said nature abhors a vacuum- and like life, the old is replaced by the unknown new. This is a very simplistic overview of the coherence/incoherence model.
          <br>
          <br>
          The electron never lands in the same place twice. Hey guys/girls this is science, so we are part of an expanding universe.If the electron doesn't get to repeat an action why should we?
          <br>
          <br>
          and yet we say history is always repeating itself- I know that I keep repeating an experience,but like a fractal it is always just a little bit different until I get the message and a little pearl of wisdom. Then the experience is never
          repeated.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Forget about the little picture of our world and look at the really big (or is it tiny) picture and extrapolate from there. Change is happening as we speak. We should all be dancing in the street.
          <br>
          <br>
          I look forward to the future and so in my thinking should all of you.
          <br>

          <br>
          The answer is "nobody" Isolationism took a new turn after the Crash of 2010. With the economic hysteria, the US began to focus solely on fixing its economy within its borders and ignored the outside world. As the world&#8217;s democratic
          powers were busy fixing their economies within their borders.Creating NAFTA - EU - CRIB this will last
          <br>
          for a few hundred years.
          <br>
          The hackers and crackers will introduce the cyber-war.
          <br>
          <br>
          That's it folks
