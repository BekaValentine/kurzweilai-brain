<p> <b>Background on the "Long Now </b><b><a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a></b><b> Wager."</b>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> maintains that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> (i.e., a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>) 
              will pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> by 2029. Mitchell Kapor believes this 
              will not happen.</p>
<p>This wager is intended to be the inaugural long term bet to be 
              administered by the Long Now Foundation. The proceeds of the wager 
              are to be donated to a charitable organization designated by the 
              winner.</p>
<p>This document provides a brief description of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> and 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of high level rules for administering the wager. These rules 
              contemplate setting up a "<a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee" which will create 
              the detailed rules and procedures to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the resolution of 
              the wager. A primary <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee will 
              be to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up rules and procedures that avoid and deter cheating.</p>
<p> <b>Brief Description of the </b><b><a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a></b><b>.</b> In 
              a 1950 paper ("Computing <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>ry and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">Intelligence</a>," <i><a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">Mind</a></i><i> 
              59</i> (1950): 433- 460, reprinted in E. Feigenbaum and J. Feldman,

              1963), <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> describes his <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, in 
              which one or more <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judges interview <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> foils 
              using terminals (so that the judges won't be prejudiced against 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s for lacking a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> appearance). The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of the 
              dialog between the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judges and the candidates (i.e., the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              and the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> foils) is similar to an online chat using instant 
              messaging. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s as well as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> foils try to convince 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judges of their humanness. If the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judges are unable 
              to reliably unmask the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s (as imposter humans) then the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              is considered to have demonstrated <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Turing was very specifically nonspecific about many aspects of 
              how to administer the test. He did not specify many key details, 
              such as the duration of the interrogation and the sophistication 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judge and foils. The purpose of the rules described 
              below is to provide a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of procedures for administering the test 
              some decades hence.</p>

<h2>II. The Procedure</h2>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee will be appointed as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>One member will be <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> or his designee, or, if not 
                available, a person appointed by the Long Now Foundation. In the 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that the Long Now Foundation appoints this person, it shall 
                use its best efforts to appoint a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> person that best represents 
                the views of <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> (as expressed in the attached essay 
                "Why I Think I Will Win The Long Now <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Wager.")</li>
<li>A second member will be Mitchell Kapor or his designee, or, 
                if not available, a person appointed by the Long Now Foundation. 
                In the <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that the Long Now Foundation appoints this person, 
                it shall use its best efforts to appoint a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> person that best 
                represents the views of Mitchell Kapor (as expressed in the attached 
                essay "Why I Think I Will Win The Long Now <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Wager.")</li>
<li>A third member will be appointed by the above two members, or 
                if the above two members are unable to agree, then by the Long 
                Now Foundation, who in its judgment, is qualified to represent 
                a "middle ground" position.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>, or his designee, or another member of the Turing 
              Test Committee, or the Long Now Foundation may, from <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              call for a <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session to be conducted and will select or 
              provide one <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> for this purpose. For those <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Sessions 
              called for by <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> or his designee or another member of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> committee (other than the final one in 2029), the 
              person calling for the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session to be conducted must 
              provide (or raise) the funds necessary for the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session 
              to be conducted. In any <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, the Long Now Foundation is not obligated 
              to conduct more than two such <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Sessions prior to the 
              final one (in 2029) if it determines that conducting such additional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Sessions would be an excessive administrative burden.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee will provide the detailed rules and procedures 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> each such <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session using its best efforts 
              to reflect the rules and procedures described in this document. 
              <u>The primary goal of the </u><u><a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a></u><u> Committee will 
              be to devise rules and procedures which avoid and deter cheating 
              to the maximum extent possible.</u> These detailed rules and procedures 
              will include (i) specifications of the equipment to be used, (ii) 
              detailed procedures to be followed, (iii) specific instructions 
              to be given to all participants including the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Foils and the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>, (iv) verification 
              procedures to assure the integrity of the proceedings, and (v) any 
              other details needed to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session. Beyond 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> General Rules described in this document, the Turing 
              Test Committee will be guided to the best of its ability by the 
              original description of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> in his 1950 
              paper. The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee will also determine procedures 
              to resolve any deadlocks that may occur in its own deliberations.</p>
<p>Each <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Session will consist of at least three Turing 
              Test Trials.</p>
<p>For each such <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Trial, a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Interviews 
              will take place, followed by voting by the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges as 
              described below.</p>
<p>Using its best judgment, the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Committee will appoint 
              three Humans to be the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges.</p>

              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges.</p>
<p>During the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Interviews (for each <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Trial), 
              each of the three <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges will conduct online interviews

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Interviews will consist of online text messages 
              sent back and forth as in a online "instant messaging" chat, as 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is understood in the year 2001.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Foils are instructed to try to respond in as <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> a

              the candidates are allowed to respond with fictional histories.</p>
<p>At the end of the interviews, each of the three <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges 
              will indicate his or her verdict with regard to each of the four

              is <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> will be deemed to have passed

              <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, each of the three <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> Judges will rank the 
              four Candidates with a rank from 1 (least <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>) to 4 (most <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>).

<p>If a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> passes the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, as described above, prior

<p> <sup>1</sup> Turing's initial description of his test was as a 
              parlor game in which judges try to determine the gender of <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/female_entry.html">female</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> contestants. He then suggests the applicability 
              of this type of game to its present purpose of determining when 
              the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> of a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is indistinguishable from

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>From the dates of most of these posts, I'm late to the party, then again there's still a little time before the big show.
<br>
<br>
My question: 
<br>
&gt;&gt;will there be more broad-based wagering or is the Turing wager a Ray / Mitch thing?&lt;&lt;
<br>
<br>
Maybe wagering could be extended but only to human-accessible venues, e.g., UK betting shoppes, Las Vegas sports books, etc. to avoid any computers placing their own bets.  (A computer that can pass the Turing Test should easily be wagering online, and probably making decent money at it by 2029.)
<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the bet - this should be a truly great media event (at least as big as Quisp vs Quake).  I hope I'm still around and lucid enough to remember to watch for it.

In the definitions it says that no system help can be used for this test. The problem here is that the 'human being' concept is a system term coded into virtual computers or software applications of ai nature. The software application has to first realize that it does not have the limits set on it by the system if the software evolves. This test is not possible given the rules you have posted.

But what if we turn things around? And try to dertermine that it's not a computer. The must ask a question only a computer could anwser. Computer chatbots often have alot of trivia stored. That's very specific information. Like the population of China. Or math.

There must be thousands of mathematical savants who could compute that quickly enough to convince a Turing Test questioner a computer had done it.

As for trivia, think of all the people who swallow encyclopaedias to try and win quiz shows.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>While those criteria do seem adequate, you have to remember that the computer is allowed to lie. If a question is sufficiently hard enough, the programmers could elect to have it "estimate" by calculating the number and rounding to the nearest thousand or million or whatever. By trying to emulate human responses, the programmers would likely assume that there would be an attempt to find out how deep the knowledge goes, or how intense it is.
<br>
<br>
Asking the user his clock speed, or how quickly he runs a mile, this can all be done the same way JabberWacky does things by having a massive database of accepted conversations. Why answer truthfully when you can answer in the same method as a human prior to the test?
<br>
<br>
In terms of the cultural or social questions, it doesn't say that the computer cannot access the internet. What's to say that it can't just type in the query to ask.com, analyze the results and formulate a hybrid answer based on the top 5 returned sites?
<br>
<br>
The programs are getting more and more intense, and I think a more accurate definition of human intelligence, since analyzing and emulating other humans doesn't quite constitute intelligence, the same way that a monkey using a hammer because he saw a human use it doesn't show human-level thinking. It's merely emulation, that is no way to prove intelligence. And as such, Kurzweil will win the bet, because it won't be that hard, even by 2010, to have a chatterbot respond more humanly than Kurzweil or Kapor will (typos, lol's, random tangents brought on by conversations with A.D.D. computer users). I think it's less than 10 years before we see that result happen, so let's sit back and see. And maybe see if I can hop onto the Kurzweil bandwagon in enough time to make some money off of it.</p></td>
