<div class="TeaserText">There is a gigantic project yet to be done that will root psychology in natural science and providing a better understanding of human nature. Once this is accomplished, you'll be able to go from phenomenology to information processing to the brain, down through the workings of the neurons, including the biochemistry, all the way to the biophysics and the way genes are up-regulated and down-regulated.</div>

<p>STEPHEN KOSSLYN: For the last 30 years I've been obsessed with 
              a question: What shape are a German Shepherd's ears? Of course, 
              I'm not literally interested in that question, since if I were I 
              could just go out and look at dogs; I'm really interested in how 
              people answer the question from <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>. Most people report that 
              they visualize the dog's head and mentally "look at" its 
              ears. But what does it mean to visualize something? What does it 
              mean to "look at it in your mind"? It's a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> absurd, 
              because there can't be a little man in there that is actually looking 
              at a picture. If there were, there would have to be a little man 
              inside that man's head, and so forth, and it doesn't make any <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>. 
            </p>
<p>For many years we tried to collect <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive evidence to show that 
              when you have the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of visualizing, there's actually something 
              pictorial in your head. It turned out that the best way to approach 
              this was by turning to the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. There are parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that 
              are physically organized such that when you look at something, a 
              corresponding <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> is physically laid out on the cortex. Even 
              the first visual area in the processing stream is often activated 
              during visual imagery -- even if your eyes are closed when you visualize. 
              Moreover, the way it's activated depends on what you're visualizing. 
              If you visualize something that's vertical, you find activation 
              along the so-called vertical meridian; if it's horizontal, the activation 
              flips over on its side. It's absolutely amazing. Similarly, visualizing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s at different sizes changes the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of activation in 
              ways very much like what occurs if you are actually seeing <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              at the corresponding sizes.</p>
<p>But I've been working on this for over 30 years now and I want 
              to move on. Instead of trying just to establish that there actually 
              are mental images and that these images are bona fide representations 
              that have a functional role in processing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, I want to ask: 
              So what? Who cares? Why should my mother be interested in this kind 
              of thing? </p>
<p>Lately I've been working on something that I'm tentatively calling 
              the "Reality Simulation Principle." It is built on my 
              lab's findings that about two-thirds of the same <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> areas are 
              involved in visual mental imagery and visual <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>. This finding 
              occurs even when the tasks seem very different on the surface (for 
              example, visualizing an upper case letter in a grid and deciding 
              whether an X mark would fall on the letter if it were actually in 
              the grid versus deciding whether a spoken name is appropriate for 
              a picture). This is a huge amount of overlap, which leads us to 
              suspect that an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> seen in a mental image can have the same 
              impact on the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> and body that the actual <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> would have. My 
              notion is that once the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are engaged, they don't know 
              where the impetus came from. This means that they can produce the 
              same effects whether you activated it endogenously (from <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>) or exogenously (from looking at something). </p>
<p>The "Reality Simulation Principle" describes how to use 
              mental images as <a class="thought" href="entries/stand_in_entry.html">stand-in</a>s for actual <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s-to manipulate yourself, 
              basically. It is useful to understand it in conjunction with what 
              I call the GITI cycle, which stands for Generate, Inspect, Transform, 
              Inspect. If mental images can simulate or stand in for actual <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              and scenes, you can generate the image, inspect what you've got, 
              transform it, and inspect the result. This can be done iteratively, 
              meaning that you can use imagery to take advantage of the "Reality 
              Simulation Principle "to do all sorts of good things for yourself. 
            </p>
<p>What kinds of good things am I talking about? <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">Memory</a> is one obvious 
              example. From the work of Alan Paivio and countless others, we know 
              that you're able to remember <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s better than pictures of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, 
              and pictures of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s better than words. It also turns out that 
              if you visualize the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s named by words you do better than you 
              would otherwise. Consequently, we're interested now in things like 
              hypnosis. We can hypnotize you, have you visualize an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, and 
              imagine that it's actually a three-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, appearing 
              in glorious vivid detail. In this case, your <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> would be boosted 
              even further.</p>
<p>Mental practice is another candidate. Neuroscientists such as Marc 
              Jeannerod and Jean Decety have shown that imagining doing something 
              recruits most of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> mechanisms that would guide the corresponding 
              actual movements. And people in sports <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> have shown that 
              by imagining that you're engaging in some activity you'll actually 
              get better at doing it. This process involves generating an image, 
              inspecting the image, transforming it by imagining your movements, 
              seeing what the result would be, and then cycling through again. 
              The next <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> through you can change the image as a function of 
              the result you saw. If you imagine you're playing golf, for example, 
              and your ball doesn't get in the hole, you can imagine what would 
              happen if you whacked it a little more softly. Mental practice clearly 
              works. By understanding how mechanisms of imagery works we can actually 
              optimize this mental practice.</p>
<p>The "Reality Simulation Principle" can also be used to 
              acquire self-<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Try this one out. Imagine it's dusk, you're 
              walking alone, and you're late. You start to walk faster and then 
              notice a short-cut through an alley. It's getting a little dark, 
              but you really don't want to be late, so you start to go towards 
              it, and you notice that there are three guys lingering near the 
              mouth of the alley. Now think about a first scenario: The three 
              guys look like they're 20 years old, are wearing long droopy shorts, 
              dirty t-shirts, baseball caps that are on backwards, and are smoking 
              cigarettes. As you get close, they stop talking, and all three heads 
              swivel and fixate on you and start tracking you. How do you feel? 
            </p>
<p>Now try the same thing, except instead of those three guys, make 
              them three balding middle age, overweight accountants wearing suits. 
              They're standing there smoking cigarettes, and their heads swivel 
              as they track you. How do you feel now? </p>
<p>You can start simulating the effects of different <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s. For 
              example, what if the guys are black or Latino teenagers. How do 
              you feel? If you can start actually sorting out your own <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al 
              landscape by running these kinds of mental simulations, you may, 
              in fact, discover certain things about yourself that may be surprising.</p>
<p>Some people who confront their own beliefs may think they've got 
              some racial issues, and it may turn out they're actually class issues. 
              Make those middle-aged accountants black and see how you feel. Those 
              kinds of simulations can help produce self-<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and can help 
              a person to improve his <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>You can also manipulate your body. It's obvious that if you have 
              a sexual fantasy you manipulate your body by imagery. Also, if you 
              imagine something scary -- an anticipated encounter with an authority 
              figure or a walk along a narrow path in the mountains that is starting 
              to crumble -- your palms will sweat and your heart beat will change. 
              It's clear that mental imagery can affect the body, but it turns 
              out that it may be more interesting than that. For example, one 
              of the things we're studying now is how to change your hormonal 
              landscape by manipulating your images. </p>
<p>There's something called the victory effect, where if you're a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> and you win some sort of contest your testosterone goes up 
              afterwards. If you lose, it goes down. This is not a surprise. It 
              also turns out that if you watch your favorite team win your testosterone 
              will go up. If your team loses, it'll go down. This even works if 
              you're watching <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>, so it's not about being aroused. In fact, 
              it works for the <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> players and for the people who are watching 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> games.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting? With men it turns out that spatial abilities 
              vary as a function of testosterone levels. In the fall, males' testosterone 
              levels are relatively high. They go down thereafter, and then they 
              pick up again. Much <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> suggests that the relation between 
              testosterone levels and spatial abilities is a U-shaped function; 
              your spatial abilities are not as good if you have too much testosterone 
              or too little testosterone. As you get older, both testosterone 
              levels and spatial abilities drop. There is a lot of evidence that 
              there is a connection between the two. The question is, can we manipulate 
              one's spatial abilities by having you run simulations of watching 
              yourself win or lose? If "Reality Simulation Principle" 
              is correct, manipulating your own testosterone levels would in turn 
              affect your spatial abilities. This is work in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in my lab, 
              in collaboration with Peter Ellison and Carole Hooven; stay tuned.</p>
<p>My point is that you can use "Reality Simulation Principle" 
              in lot of different ways, including some ways that are not intuitively 
              obvious, such as manipulating your hormonal landscape. Mental imagery 
              is also <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant in <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and problem solving. Einstein reported 
              that most of his <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> was done with images prior to any kind 
              of verbal or mathematical statement. We know quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> now about 
              how to use images in the service of solving problems and being creative. 
              In fact, Ron Finke has written a couple of unusually creative books 
              on this topic.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This article is fascinating and places in words what I've been thinking about for quite awhile. As a child I always had an active imagination and would often visualize simple, mundane activities, and would seem to get better at these activities even without "real" practice. I've been doing this for many years, and I am always very pleased with the outcome. 
<br>
<br>
I've been an amateur musician now for over 10 years, focusing mainly on bass guitar and keyboards. I've recently had a desire to learn guitar. During the evenings, right before bed, I'll place headphones on and visualize musical artists playing the guitar, moving between chords. I've never been a great guitar player, but I've been amazed at how this simple mental technique has helped me move between chord and increase my finger dexterity. Within a couple of weeks, I am playing like I've been practicing several months. 
<br>
<br>
I read articles all the time how scientists are trying to cheat the need for sleep so humans can stay awake longer and use that time more productively. I would much rather sleep, but practice useful skills during my sleep. Imagine the possibilities! Foreign languages, music, the skies the limit. </p></td>
