<div class="TeaserText">This postscript to his One Half of a Manifesto is a further discussion and criticism of exponential trends. Do these trends exist as predictive models, or are we playing connect-the-dots based upon an arbitrary selection of milestones and paradigm shifts?</div>
<br>
<br><p>Read Ray Kurzweil's response <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040349/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0236.html" target="_self">here</a>. "One Half of a Manifesto" can be read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040349/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0232.html" target="_self">here</a>. Originally published November 20, 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011040349/http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge78.html" target="_new">Edge</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 30, 2001.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, Ray Kurzweil and I spoke in succession (in Atlanta, at one of Vanguard's events) just as I was writing these responses. We see the world quite differently. He would certainly reject my last claim above, that fundamental intellectual achievement isn't inexorably speeding up.</p>
<p>I see punctuated equilibria in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Right now we're in the midst of an explosion of new <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>. Around the turn of the last century there was an explosion of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and insight about <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">Physics</a> is now <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for its next explosion but hasn't found it yet.</p>
<p>I also see a distinction between quantity and quality that Ray doesn't. I see <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s getting bigger and faster, but it doesn't directly follow that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> is also improving exponentially.</p>
<p>Ray sees everything as speeding up, including the speed of the speedup. In Atlanta, he collected varied graphic portrayals of exponential historical processes in a slide show, and labeled these a "countdown" to the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> he predicts will arrive about a quarter of the way into the new century.</p>
<p>His exponential histories blend what others might think of as varied phenomena together into categories without differentiation. For instance, he showed a slide about <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, but with the timeframe not limited to the era of the <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>. Instead, he defines chips as just one of five technological phases that have upheld the exponential speedup of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> that started with the earliest mechanical calculation <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s. He infers that the curve will be continued with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nological or other <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s once the limits of <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are reached, in perhaps twelve years. Likewise he showed a grand exponential account of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> that started with items like the <a class="thought" href="entries/cambrian_entry.html">Cambrian</a> Explosion at the foot of the curve and soared to modern technological marvels at its heights, as if these were all of a kind.</p>
<p>I hope I can avoid being cast as the person who precisely disagrees with Ray, since I think we agree on many things. There <i>are</i> exponential phenomena at work, of course, but I feel they have robust contrarian company. I believe our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> story is not best defined by a smooth curve, even at a large scale (although I try to make one exception, which I'll describe below). If there was ever a complex, chaotic phenomenon, we are it.</p>
<p>One question I have about Ray's exponential theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> is whether he is stacking the deck by choosing points that fit the curves he wants to find. A technological pessimist could demonstrate a slow-down in <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> exploration, for instance, by starting with <a class="thought" href="entries/sputnik_entry.html">sputnik</a>, and then proceeding to the Apollo and the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttle <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s and then to the recent bad luck with Mars missions. Projecting this curve into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> could serve as a basis for arguing that <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> exploration will inexorably wind down. I've actually heard such <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing put forward by antagonists of <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a>'s budget. I don't think it's a meaningful extrapolation, but it's essentially similar to Ray's arguments for technological hyper-<a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a>.</p>
<p>It's also possible that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary processes might display local exponential features at only some scales. <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a> might be a grand scale "<a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>" that periodically exhibits <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> as it finds an insulated cul-de-sac of the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> that can be quickly explored. These are regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> where the vanguard of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary mutation experimentation comes upon a limited theater within which it can play out exponential games like arms races and population explosions. I suspect you can always find exponential sub processes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, but they don't give form to the biggest picture.</p>
<p>Here's one example: The dinosaurs were apparently "scaled" (maybe in both the traditional and <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_valley_entry.html">Silicon Valley</a> senses of the word!) by an "arms race", leading to larger and larger <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. Dinosaurs were not the only creatures at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that relied on gigantism as a strategy. Much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> kingdom was becoming huger at once. I doubt the size competition proceeded at a linear rate. Arms races rarely do.</p>
<p>If we were dinosaurs debating this question, the Kurzweilosaurus might argue that our descendants would soon be big enough to stand on their toes and touch the moon, and not long after that become as big as the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. (Tribute is due, as always, to Mark Twain and his erectile Mississippi.)</p>
<p>The race to bigness came to a halt, perhaps because of a spaceborne cataclysm. Whatever the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for the dinosaurs' disappearance, they could not have become bigger without bounds. Furthermore, the race to bigness did not inexorably reappear, but was replaced by other races. The mere appearance of an exponential sequence does not mean that it will not encounter an impassable boundary, or become untraceable as other processes exert their influences.</p>
<p>I see a scattered distribution of local, bounded exponential processes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, while Ray sees these processes all focusing like a coherent <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> on a point in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> we will likely live to see.</p>
<p>Smart people can be fooled by trends. For instance, in 1666, when technological <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> was perhaps even more pronounced than it is today (when <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> exploration seemed to be <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing exponentially, for instance), <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Magazine presented what it <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> was a sober prediction: That by the <a class="thought" href="entries/y2k_entry.html">year 2000</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> would have advanced to the point that no one in America would work for a living. Automation would take the drudgery out of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. Each American citizen would receive a healthy middle class stipend in the mail every month simply for being American. A specific dollar amount ($30-$40,000 in 1966 dollars) was even projected for the stipend. (Thanks to GBN's Eamonn Kelly for pointing out this example.)</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Magazine was making what it saw as a perfectly <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able extrapolation based on legitimate <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. What went wrong with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a>'s prediction? There's no doubt that <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> continued to improve in the second half of the twentieth century, and by most interpretations it did so at an exponential clip. <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">Productivity</a> faithfully increased on an exponential curve as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few candidate failings: Public rejection of key predicted technologies such as nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>; "lock in" of such things as cars and freeways, which did not scale cheaply or elegantly; population explosions; increasingly unequal distributions of wealth; entrenchment in law and habit of the work ethic; and perhaps even the beginning of the "<a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> of helpdesks" scenario that made a cameo appearance in the .5 manifesto. This last possibility provides an alternate way to think about the growing "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> economy".</p>
<p>Note that some of these countervailing <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s are exponential in their own right. Population <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> is a classic example of an exponential process that can absorb an exponential increase in available resources. This is what has happened with high yield agriculture in India.</p>
<p>What's really tricky is figuring out when one process will outrun its surroundings for a while in a meaningful way, as the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> has grown at a faster rate than the population or the larger economy.</p>
<p>I have to admit that I want to believe in one particular large scale, smooth, ascending curve as a governor of mankind's <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. Specifically, I want to believe that moral <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> has been real, and continues today. This is not an easy thing to believe in. I formed my desire to believe in it at about the same that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">Time</a> Magazine made it's prediction about the end of work.</p>
<p>I remember being a child in the 1960s, and there was a giddy feeling in the air of accelerating social change. While the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> was different, the idea wasn't that different from today's <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/eschatology_entry.html">eschatology</a>. It felt like the world was on an exponential course of change, approaching a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>.</p>
<p>The evidence was there. You could have plotted the points on a graph and seen one of Ray's curves, but no one <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to do it explicitly at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. 1776, Civil War, Women's Suffrage, Civil Rights Struggle, Anti-war movement, Women's lib, Gay Rights, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">Animal</a> rights--You could plot all these on a graph and see an exponential rate of expansion of the "Circle of Empathy" I wrote about in the .5 Manifesto. This process seemed to be destined to zoom into a <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> around 1969 or so, when I was nine years old. People were quite depressed when the <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a> did not happen. Younger people today might not realize how deeply that <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">singularity</a>'s no-show marked the lives of a vast number of Baby Boomers.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs did not become as large as the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, work did not disappear in 2000 (at least not by November, 2000, as I write this), and <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> did not conquer all in 1969. All the trends were real, but were either interrupted, outran their own internal logics, ran out of world to expand into, or were balanced or consumed by other processes.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I found Mr. Lanier's ideas to be unconvincing here. Dinosaurs didn't grow to the moon
<br>
because there are physical limits obviously to how large such a creature can grow. In
<br>
other words they maxed out their S-curve and didn't find a new paradigm to take them
<br>
even larger. Jaron acknowledges that. Space exploration is at such an early stage that
<br>
we have too few datapoints to say whether or not it will continue to increase, and Jaron
<br>
says so. Then he brings up the promises made by /magazines/ in the 60s, which were
<br>
obviously not based on datapoints, but rather on wishful thinking. In fact, if you were
<br>
to actually graph out the datapoints you would see that Time Magazine is likely to be
<br>
right in the long term through the use of nanotech and the Singularity, they just had
<br>
the timing wrong.
<br>
<br>
At any rate, you can see that I found the "counterexamples" to be lacking. I also found
<br>
no actual criticism of Ray's (and other people's) viewpoint that computing power and
<br>
other technologies will continue to increase past 2012 or whenever current silicon
<br>
techniques max out. It seems very plausible to me, what with many new technologies
<br>
already under development: molectronics, spintronics, quantum computing, nanotech/
<br>
computronium, etc. Perhaps if Jaron could really make an argument against these
<br>
Singularity-driving technologies then we could really have something to think about.
<br>
<br>
As for the morality issues he tries to bring up, I think he may be pleasantly surprised
<br>
by what the Singularity may have to offer in that area. What he really should be
<br>
considering though is not whether Ray is wrong (in which case there will be no
<br>
Singularity any time soon, so we are wasting our time here), but what if Ray is
<br>
right? If Ray and the others are right, then we need to be thinking about what is
<br>
the safest way to get to and create a Singularity, and should we consider trying to
<br>
get there even more quickly? If Jaron is right that technology development is somewhat
<br>
chaotic, then we DO have the opportunity here to speed up (or slow down) things
<br>
quite significantly. Depending on your viewpoint, this could either save a lot of lives
<br>
(150,000 or more people die every day...) or push doomsday farther back if you are
<br>
one of those convinced the Singularity is automatically bad. Personally I think the
<br>
Singularity can be both manipulated in time and also in outcome, and it is our very
<br>
important responsibility to think a great deal about this possibility. Being conservative
<br>
in this situation is considering all this and planning for the potential- NOT saying it
<br>
won't/can't happen and letting someone possibility create the future right under your
<br>
feet.
