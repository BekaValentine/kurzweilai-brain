<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> enhancement&#8212;our ability to use <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to enhance 
              our bodies and minds, as opposed to its application for therapeutic 
              purposes&#8212;is a critical issue facing <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. It will 
              be involved in some of the near-term applications of nanotechnology, 
              with such <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> labs as MIT's Institute for Soldier Technologies 
              working on exoskeletons and other innovations that increase human 
              strength and capabilities. It is also a core issue related to far-term 
              predictions in nanotechnology, such as longevity, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> and other issues. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The implications of nanotechnology as related to human enhancement 
              are perhaps some of the most personal and therefore passionate issues 
              in the emerging field of nanoethics, forcing us to rethink what 
              it means to be human or, essentially, our own <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>. For some, 
              nanotechnology holds the promise of making us superhuman; for others, 
              it offers a darker path toward becoming Frankenstein's monster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without advocating any particular side of the debate, this essay 
              will look at a growing chorus of calls for human enhancement, especially 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of emerging technologies, to be embraced and unrestricted. 
              We will critically examine recent "pro-enhancement" arguments&#8212;articulated 
              in <i>More Than Human</i> (2005) by Ramez Naam<sup><a name="r1"></a><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>, 
              as one of the most visible works on the subject today&#8212;and conclude 
              that they ultimately need to be repaired, if they are to be convincing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 align="center">I</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Before we proceed, we should lay out a few actual and possible 
              scenarios in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to be clear on what we mean by "human enhancement." 
              In addition to steroid use to become stronger and plastic surgery 
              to become more attractive, people today also use drugs to boost 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a>, attentiveness, <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a>, and more. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, 
              nanotechnology might give us implants that enable us to see in the 
              dark, or in currently non-visible spectrums such as infrared. As 
              artificial intelligence advances, nano-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s might be imbedded 
              into our bodies in order to help process more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> faster, 
              even to the point where man and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> become indistinguishable. 
            </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These scenarios admittedly sound like <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, but with 
              nanotechnology, we move much closer to turning them into <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. 
              Atomically-precise manufacturing techniques continue to become more 
              refined and will be able to build cellular-level sensors and other 
              tools that can be integrated into our bodies. Indeed, designs have 
              already been worked out for such innovations as a "respirocyte"&#8212;an 
              artificial red blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> that holds a reservoir of <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>.<sup><a name="r2"></a><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> 
              A respirocyte would come in handy for, say, a heart attack victim 
              to continue breathing for an extra hour until medical treatment 
              is available, despite a lack of blood circulation to the lungs or 
              anywhere else. But in an otherwise-healthy athlete, a respirocyte 
              could boost performance by delivering extra oxygen to the muscles, 
              as if the person were breathing from a pure oxygen tank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we do not mean by "human enhancement" is the mere use of tools, 
              such as a hammer or <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> Word, to aid human activities, or 
              "natural" improvements of diet and exercise&#8212;though, as we shall 
              discuss later, agreeing on a definition may not be a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>. 
              Further, we must distinguish the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> from therapeutic applications, 
              such as using steroids to treat any <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of medical conditions, 
              which we take to be unobjectionable for the purposes of this essay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, our discussion here can benefit from quickly noting some 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>s on both sides of the debate. The anti-enhancement 
              camp may point to steroids in sports as an argument for regulating 
              technology: that it corrupts the notion of fair competition. Also, 
              some say, by condoning enhancement we are setting the wrong example 
              for our children, encouraging risky behavior in bodies that are 
              still developing. "Human dignity" is also a recurring theme for 
              this side, believing that such enhancements pervert the notion of 
              what it means to be human (with all our flaws).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the pro-enhancement side, it seems obvious that the desire for 
              self-improvement is morally laudable. Attempts to improve ourselves 
              through, for example, <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, hard work, and so on are uncontroversially 
              good; why should technology-based enhancements be viewed any differently? 
              In addition to virtue-based defenses of technological enhancement, 
              we might also appeal to <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> to defend the practice: 
              so long as rational, autonomous individuals freely choose to participate 
              in these projects, intervention against them is morally problematic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In <i>More Than Human</i>, it is interesting to see that the debate 
              is framed as a conservative (anti-enhancement) versus liberal (pro-enhancement) 
              issue<sup><a name="r3"></a><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>. This proposed 
              dichotomy is undoubtedly influenced by the creation and work of 
              the U.S. President's Council on Bioethics. Led by Leon Kass, M.D., 
              PhD, the council released a report, <i>Beyond Therapy</i>, in 2004 
              that endorsed an anti-enhancement position; this report has become 
              the prime target for both liberals and pro-enhancement groups. However, 
              it would be a mistake to think that the issue necessarily follows 
              political lines, since there may be good <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for a liberal to 
              be anti-enhancement, as well as for a conservative to support it.</p>
<h2 align="center"> </h2>
<h2 align="center">II</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In his introductory chapter, Naam outlines the overarching theme 
              that is supported by his research and analysis in subsequent chapters. 
              He offers four distinct arguments in defending the pro-enhancement 
              position: first, there are pragmatic reasons for embracing enhancement; 
              second, regulation will not work anyway; third, respect for our 
              autonomy licenses the practices; and, fourth, that the desire to 
              enhance is inherently human and therefore must be respected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1.</b> In his first argument, Naam points out that "scientists 
              cannot draw a clear line between healing and enhancing."<sup><a name="r4"></a><a href="#f4">4</a></sup> 
              The implied conclusion here is that, if no principled distinction 
              can be made between two concepts, it is irrational to afford them 
              different moral status. So, since there are no restrictions on therapy, 
              in that we have a right to medical aid, there also should be no 
              restrictions on human enhancement, <i>i.e.</i> using the same medical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s or procedures to improve our already-healthy bodies. In 
              other words, there is no significant or moral difference between 
              therapy and enhancement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are numerous problems with such a claim; we will herein elucidate 
              two. The first problem can be illustrated by the famous philosophical 
              puzzle called "The <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">Paradox</a> of the Heap": given a heap of sand with 
              N number of grains of sand, if we remove one grain of sand, we are 
              still left with a heap of sand (that now only has N-1 grains of 
              sand). If we remove one more grain, we are again left with a heap 
              of sand (that now has N-2 grains). If we extend this line of reasoning 
              and continue to remove grains of sand, we see that there is no clear 
              point where we can definitely say that on side A, here is a heap 
              of sand, but on the side B, this is less than a heap. In other words, 
              there is no clear distinction between a heap of sand and a less-than-a-heap 
              or even no sand at all. However, the wrong conclusion to draw here 
              is that there is no difference between them; so likewise, it would 
              be fallacious to conclude that there is no <i>difference</i> between 
              therapy and enhancement. It may still be the case that there is 
              no <i>moral </i>difference between the two, but we cannot arrive 
              at it through the argument that there is no clear defining line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, second, there likely <i>are</i> principled distinctions that 
              can be made between enhancement and therapy.<sup><a name="r5"></a><a href="#f5">5</a></sup> 
              For example, Norm Daniels has argued for the use of "quasi-statistical 
              concepts of 'normality' to argue that any intervention designed 
              to restore or preserve a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>-typical level of functioning for 
              an individual should count as [therapy]"<a name="r6"></a><sup><a href="#f6">6</a></sup> 
              and the rest as enhancement. Alternatively, Eric Juengst has proposed 
              that therapies aim at pathologies which compromise health, whereas 
              enhancements aim at improvements that are not health-related.<sup><a name="r7"></a><a href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another pragmatic reason Naam gives is that "we cannot stop research 
              into enhancing ourselves without also halting research focused on 
              healing the sick and injured."<a name="r8"></a><sup><a href="#f8">8</a></sup> 
              However, this claim seems to miss the point: anti-enhancement advocates 
              can simply counter that it is not the research they want stopped 
              or regulated, but rather the use of that research or its products 
              for enhancement. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, we may want to ban steroids from 
              sports, but no one is calling for an outright ban on all steroids 
              research, much of which serves healing purposes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Naam also puts the burden of proof&#8212;that regulation of enhancement 
              is needed&#8212;on the anti-enhancement side, instead of offering 
              an argument that enhancement need not be regulated.<sup><a name="r9"></a><a href="#f9">9</a></sup> 
              But it is unclear here why we should abandon the principle of erring 
              on the side of caution, particularly where human health may be at 
              stake as well as other societal impacts. Further, both sides have 
              already identified a list of benefits or harms that might arise 
              from unregulated human enhancement. The problem now is to evaluate 
              these benefits and harms against each other (<i>e.g.</i>, increased 
              longevity versus overpopulation), also factoring in any relevant 
              human rights. If neither side is able to convincingly show that 
              benefits outweigh harms, or vice versa, then burden of proof seems 
              to be a non-issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2.</b> In his second argument, Naam compares a ban on enhancement 
              to the U.S. "War on Drugs," citing its ineffectiveness as well as 
              externalities such as artificially high prices and increased safety 
              risks (<i>e.g.</i>, users having to share needles because they cannot 
              obtain new or clean ones) for those who will use drugs anyway.<sup><a name="r10"></a><a href="#f10">10</a></sup> 
              If people are as avidly driven to enhancement as they are to drugs, 
              then yes, this may be the case. But is that a good enough reason 
              to not even try to contain a problem, whether it is drugs, prostitution, 
              gambling, or whatever? While such laws may be paternalistic, they 
              reflect the majority consensus that a significant number of people 
              cannot act responsibly in these activities and need to be protected 
              from themselves and from inevitably harming others. Even many liberals 
              are not categorically opposed to these regulations and may see the 
              rationale of "greater good" behind similar regulation of enhancement. 
            </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Further, that we are unable to totally stop an activity does not 
              seem to be reason at all against prohibiting that activity. If it 
              were, then we would not have any laws against murder, speeding, 
              "illegal" immigration&#8212;in fact, it is unclear what laws we would 
              have left. Laws exist precisely because some people inescapably 
              have tendencies to the opposite of what is desired by <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> or 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>. Again, this is not to say that human enhancement should 
              be prohibited, only that a stronger and more compelling argument 
              is needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>3.</b> In his third argument, Naam ties human enhancement to 
              the debate over human <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a>: "Should individuals and families 
              have the right to alter their own minds and bodies, or should that 
              power be held by the state? In a democratic society, it's every 
              man and woman who should determine such things, not the state...Governments 
              are instituted to secure individual rights, not to restrict them."<sup><a name="r11"></a><a href="#f11">11</a></sup>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides politicizing a debate that need not be political, Naam's 
              arguments are increasingly not anti-conservative but pro-libertarian. 
              You would need to have already adopted the libertarian <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> 
              to accept this line of reasoning (as well as the preceding argument), 
              since again, even liberals can see that the state has a broader 
              role in creating a functioning, orderly society. This necessarily 
              entails reasonable limits to whatever natural rights we have and 
              also implies new responsibilities&#8212;for example, we shouldn't 
              exercise our right to free speech by slandering or by yelling "Fire!" 
              in a crowded theater. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A democratic society is not compelled to endorse <i>laissez-faire</i> 
              political philosophy and the minimal state, as some political philosophers 
              have suggested.<sup><a name="r12"></a><a href="#f12">12</a></sup> 
              Nor would reasonable people necessarily want unrestricted freedom, 
              <i>e.g.</i> no restrictions or background checks for gun ownership. 
              Even in a democracy as liberal as ours in the United States, we 
              understand the value of regulations as a way to enhance our freedom. 
              For instance, our economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is not truly a "free market"&#8212;though 
              we advocate freedom in general, regulations exist not only to protect 
              our rights, but also to create an orderly process that greases the 
              economic wheel, accelerating both innovations and transactions. 
              As a simpler example, by disciplining a dog to obey commands and 
              not run around unchecked, we actually increase that pet's freedom 
              by now being able to take him or her on more walks and perhaps without 
              a leash (not to compare people with dogs or laws with behavioral 
              conditioning).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>4.</b> Finally, Naam argues that people have been enhancing 
              themselves from the start: "Far from being unnatural, the drive 
              to alter and improve on ourselves is a fundamental part of who we 
              humans are. As a species we've always looked for ways to be faster, 
              stronger, and smarter and to live longer."<a name="r13"></a><sup><a href="#f13">13</a></sup> 
              This seems to be an accurate observation, but it is an argumentative 
              leap from this fact about the world, which is descriptive, to a 
              moral conclusion about the world, which is normative. Or, as the 
              philosophical saying goes, we cannot derive "ought" from "is," meaning 
              just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it should be 
              that way or must continue to be that way. For instance, would the 
              fact that we have engaged in wars&#8212;or slavery, or intolerance&#8212;across 
              the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> imply that we should continue 
              with those activities? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>More seriously, this argument seems to turn on an overly-broad 
              definition of "human enhancement," such that it includes the use 
              of tools, diet, exercise, and so on&#8212;or what we would intuitively 
              call "natural" improvement. An <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ion to Naam's first argument 
              also applies here: just because we cannot clearly delineate between 
              enhancement and therapy or tool-use does not mean there is no line 
              between them. We understand that steroid use by baseball players 
              is a case of human enhancement; we also understand that using a 
              rock to crack open a clam is not. Still, the fact that we have not 
              arrived at a clear definition of "human enhancement" should not 
              prevent us from using intuitive distinctions to meaningfully discuss 
              the issue.</p>
<h2 align="center"> </h2>
<h2 align="center"><b>III</b></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The point here is not that human enhancement <i>should</i> be restricted. 
              It is simply that current arguments need to be more compelling and 
              philosophically rigorous, if the pro-enhancement side is to be successful. 
              There is admittedly a strong intuition driving the pro-enhancement 
              movement, but it needs to be articulated more fully, resulting in 
              an argument something like the following: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who we are now seems to be a product of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> and nurture, most 
              of which is beyond our control. So, if this genetic-environmental 
              lottery is truly random, then why should we be constrained to its 
              results? After all, we've never agreed to such a process in the 
              first place. Why not enhance ourselves to be on par with the capabilities 
              of others? And if that is morally permissible, then why not go a 
              little&#8212;or a lot&#8212;beyond the capabilities of others? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As suggested in the above analysis, one of the first steps in discussing 
              human enhancement is to arrive at a better definition of what it 
              is, perhaps by adopting that used by Daniels or Juengst, though 
              these are still tough issues. For instance, does it matter whether 
              enhancements are worn outside our bodies as opposed to being implanted? 
              Why should carrying around a Pocket <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> or binoculars be acceptable, 
              but having a computer or a "bionic eye" implanted in our bodies 
              be subject to possible regulation&#8212;what is the moral difference 
              between the two?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Further, there are societal and ethical implications that also 
              need to be considered, apart from those already mentioned. Before 
              we too quickly dismiss the idea of "human dignity" as romanticized 
              and outdated, we need to give it full consideration and ask whether 
              that concept would suffer if human enhancement were unrestricted. 
              Is there an obligation to enhance our children, or will parents 
              feel pressure to do so? Might there be an "Enhancement Divide," 
              similar to the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Divide, that significantly disadvantages 
              those without? If some people can interact with the world in ways 
              that are unimaginable to others (such as echolocation or seeing 
              in infrared), will that create a further "<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">Communication</a> Divide" 
              such that people no longer share the same <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s in order 
              to communicate with each other?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this essay, we have tried to detail some of the challenges that 
              nanotechnology and nanoethics will confront as applications to human 
              enhancement become technologically viable. This will not be in the 
              distant future, but rather sooner than many of us might have expected. 
              It seems to the authors that a balanced and reasonable perspective 
              is more appropriate than either polarizing extreme, if we are to 
              responsibly and productively advance nanotechnology and its applications, 
              particularly in <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> of the challenges to the pro-enhancement position 
              that we have described.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Patrick and Fritz
<br>
My two cents worth on your excellent article on some of the ethics of enhancement.  To briefly summarize your position you indicate the following rationales for enhancement by Naam
<br>
<br>
'	Healing and enhancement there is no difference
<br>
'	Ban is ineffective so keep doing it
<br>
'	Right to chose is with the individual
<br>
'	We have always done it
<br>
<br>
You then move in part III to attempt to put more moral force behind the pro-enhancement argument.  Which I hope I summarise correctly as; because being born is not our fault we have right therefore to tinker with ourselves.  You then go on to say, "The point here is not that human enhancement should be restricted. It is simply that current arguments need to be more compelling and philosophically rigorous, if the pro-enhancement side is to be successful."  
<br>
<br>
You write in your essay as if it is the pro-enhancement side that needs to do the work. It seems to me it is the other way round. Unfortunately the move towards greater enhancement is the status quo.  It many ways it does not need to argue it side it is just happening.  If you can't get here you can go to Asia and get it even cheaper.  This will continue to be the case.  Our drives towards mastery (call it narcissism if you will) or a drive towards safety pushes us in this direction.  The most moral of us will still have a seduction in this direction. It is part of who we are as human beings.  Much of this has been written about in both Sandel's paper and a series of responses to it in the American Journal of Bioethics last year
<br>
<br>
It is the anti enhancers that need to find good arguments for not doing this or for limiting to this.  It is hard to find a saleable argument against the slogan of "look better, feel better, be stronger, think better".  I have left happiness off of the slogan as there is no evidence than any of the parts of the slogan will necessarily make people feel happier.
<br>
<br>
With the coming of molecular manufacturing as well as the more imminent coming of robotics one likely scenarios is that significant amount of the population will no longer work or need to work.  Robots will do most of it and molecular manufacturing will provide cheap or free basics.  The bottom part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is fulfilled.
<br>
<br>
This will lead to a shift that may allow people to look for more psychological satisfactions in their lives.  What is living forever without achievement, satisfaction, happiness and love.  When everyone is beautiful buff and brainy how do you stand out in a crowd.  Enhancement will not bring happiness.  This is clear from the existing research on the lack of correlation between happiness and money (unless you earn under $8000).
<br>
<br>
This in my view is the false argument inherent in pro-enhancement.  It will make me happier.    Maybe this is the one argument against enhancement is that it does not satisfy many of our basic psychological needs.  I do not believe we can put many curbs on enhancement, just look at our feeble attempts to stop doping and drugging at the Olympics, enhancement is often at least one step of detection.  Body building is so rife with enhancement that they now ho9ld competitions for the enhanced and non-enhanced.  Market forces alone will drive enhancement against the best of our moral arguments.
<br>
<br>
The question for me then becomes given it is and will continue to happen, what do we do to make it safer and how do we curb its excesses.  Essentially from a societal view to treat it as a legal drug.  At the same time we need to highlight that one still has to find purpose in life even when one is rich, famous and beautiful as we will all be.  
<br>
<br>
My argument is that we have de facto accepted enhancement as part of our society or can realistically do nothing about its continued implementation.
<br>
<br>
Given this then the ethics become more about its use in our society.  This would include
<br>
<br>
'	The ethics of distribution i.e. who gets it and who has access to it
<br>
'	The ethics of implementation, which raises questions such as how much is to much enhancement, choices about enhancement of others such as babies at birth
<br>
'	The ethics of safety
<br>
<br>
All of this aside, as much as I try to make happiness a value in my life I still can't wait to get that chip in my head and wire up to the universe.  We are a fickle lot.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Patrick Lin and Fritz Allhoff's stimulating essay attempts to shift the burden of proof (that no regulation is required) to the pro-enhancement side.   The burden of proof is by default, as Chris Allen points out, the other way around.  This ordering is also demanded by the moral principles upon which human freedoms rest.  In the U.S. 'we hold these truths to be self evident.'
<br>
<br>
Yes, there are restrictions on some freedoms and these ultimately derive from the principle that the freedom of action of the individual is only tenable when it respects the mutual freedom of action of all individuals.  And these restrictions come about when there is clear evidence that the action in question violates the principle of mutual freedom.  
<br>
<br>
It is the burden of legislators to show that the action of enhancement itself violates the principle of mutual freedom.  Failing that, they might try to show that certain enhancements lead inexorably or have no other purpose than to support actions that violate the principle and then place restrictions on only those enhancements.  
<br>
<br>
You don't have to be a Libertarian to see the logic that in a country founded upon the basic principle that man has certain inalienable rights (including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness),  that the burden is upon those who would restrict those rights to show beyond a doubt that the actions to be restricted cause harm to others.
<br>
<br>
So let us turn to the question of how others, i.e. non-enhancers, will be harmed or have their inalienable rights infringed by enhancers.   Existing laws already handle the case where an enhanced person uses an enhancement (say heat ray vision) to attack another person.  This is handled by the same laws that handle attacking another person with a hammer, or fists.  What remains is indirect harm which Lin and Allhoff address in their supposition of the rise of an enhanced/non-enhanced divide akin to the so called digital divide of the information age.  
<br>
<br>
Fears about such a divide are based in a zero-sum game paradigm of survival.  In other words, if enhanced humans can always beat me in the competition for limited jobs then I will starve and die.  But life in society is not a zero-sum game.  The better we humans get at producing, the more we produce, for everyone ' and the more jobs open up in fields that require human creativity and artistic expression.  History has shown time and again that new technology eventually elevates the living condition of all humans.   
<br>
<br>
However new technologies can temporarily cause hardship when they replace the need for human labor.  During these dislocations the way in which goods are distributed in society demands that displaced workers find something else to do to benefit their fellow man or'find a bread line.  Their will be no shortage of bread, at least.  
<br>
<br>
This brings me to the issues that Chris Allen raised about the 'ethics of distribution'.  Allen's highlighting of this issue presupposes that something other than normal market forces should determine or have a hand in the distribution of enhancement technology.  Again, the burden of proof that anything but market forces should determine distribution lies with those who wish to interfere in the market for similar reasons to those stated above as to why the burden of proof for enhancement regulation lies with anti-enhancers.
<br>
<br>
Thank you, Patrick and Fritz, for your provocative essay and thank you, Chris, for your insightful analysis.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>As the co-author of the paper in question, thanks for your thoughtful comments, Chris and John.  I just saw your posts and want to think about them more before I post a substantive response here.  But in the meantime, if you're interested, I had posted some comments last week on this blog: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011095124/http://bioethicsdiscussion.blogspot.com/2006/03/human-enhancement-through.html" target="_blank">http://bioethicsdiscussion.blogspot.com/2006/03/hu  man-enhancement-through.html</a>
<br>
<br>
One quick thought, however, is that when it comes to these discussions (as opposed to, say, an IRS audit or a lawsuit), there's something  intellectually-suspect about assigning burden of proof on only one side.  I would hold both sides up to the same standard of offering a defensible, positive argument for their position, rather than relying on tearing down the opposition's.  So if the pro-enhance side really is defensible, then there should be some kind of proactive argument for it, no?
<br>
<br>
Anyway, more thoughts to come, so please stay tuned!
<br>
<br>
- Pat</p></td>

Above and beyond that some people will want specialised enhancements, prehensile tails for example are clearly not for everyone in the same way as tattoos and piercings are not. I personally would like to sport a splendid set of wings, at least for a while.

I see no reason why someone going on a diving holiday would not want respirocytes (has the acronym SCUBA ever been more apt?) and the more adventurous might want their eyes modified so that they could focus underwater and maybe even some webbing between the fingers, all of which could be undone after the holiday.</p></td>

<center><p class="mindxquote"> "This necessarily entails reasonable limits to whatever natural rights we have and also implies new responsibilities'for example, we shouldn't exercise our right to free speech by slandering or by yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater." </p></center>
<br>
First, freedom of speech -- the 1st amendment -- is a limit on government power, not individuals. That said, damage can be done by speech; defamation of character. Yelling FIRE! in a crowded theater creates an immediate threat. Both cause harm to persons; violates their inalienable right to life and property.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "Nor would reasonable people necessarily want unrestricted freedom, e.g. no restrictions or background checks for gun ownership." </p></center>
<br>
Back ground checks for gun ownership are a relatively recent regulation. Criminals that don't obey the law don't buy registered guns or go though back ground checks. Ending the supply of black-market guns is as improbable as eliminating alcohol during prohibition or eliminating illicit drugs by the War on some Drugs. Vermont has no background check and it's not the "wild west, blood in the streets" that was the talking points used to persuade people that background checks would be effective at reducing crime. Where do "reasonable" people get their information that you deem them 'reasonable'? More in a minute.
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "As a simpler example, by disciplining a dog to obey commands and not run around unchecked, we actually increase that pet's freedom by now being able to take him or her on more walks and perhaps without a leash (not to compare people with dogs or laws with behavioral conditioning). </p></center>
<br>
That's analogous to why traffic laws are effective. It gives drivers operating heavy machinery a reasonable expectation of what other vehicles are doing. Will that car stop at the intersection; what speed is the traffic I'm pulling into; in a traffic circle who has the right of way, and etc.? The intent is to have an orderly flow of potentially dangerous, heavy machinery from each other (drivers) and pedestrians.
<br>
<br>
How technology advancing exponentially will effect politics, politicians and bureaucrats.
<br>
People are fundamentally honest. The vast majority of people, probably 98+% don't commit theft, assault, rape murder or threat's thereof. Objective laws prohibit those acts. Good thing too, else wise we'd be living in anarchy and chaos. 
<br>
<br>
The reason a vast majority of people don't commit those crimes is not because they're against the law. But because they abide the golden rule; do unto others as you would have others do unto you; mind your business and I'll mind mine.
<br>
<br>
The federal government creates an average 3,000 new laws and regulations each year. Each state creates about a third as many. Excluding traffic laws, almost every person breaks the law several times a year. That's massive, widespread crime. Each new law and regulation is proposed by politicians and bureaucrats as a must-have, necessary law,  to protect people and society from harming themselves and or others and society. There's a reason members of congress are often called lawmakers.
<br>
<br>
Such anarchy. Such chaos. I don't think so.
<br>
<br>
Despite the encompassing lawlessness persons and society have not self-destructed or collapsed. Instead, persons and society have increasingly prospered. That certainly isn't anarchy or chaos. Those laws being broken are political agenda laws. 
<br>
<br>
For example, how is it that persons and society of decades past increasingly prospered without the forthcoming laws. How is it that persons and society of today increasingly prosper without the supposed benefit of new laws yet to come next year, three years and fifteen years into the future?
<br>
<br>
Does a reasonable person believe that individuals and society are in a constant state of being precariously perched on a cliff-edge just one step away from self-destruction, awaiting being saved by politicians bureaucrats with their next new, must-have necessary law? 
<br>
<br>
No.
<br>
<br>
"There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power government has is the power to crack down on criminals. When there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.' ' Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged
<br>
<br>
Two examples of increasing chaos. The income tax is chaos. The solution is a national retail sales tax. Particularly the FairTax.
<br>
<br>
Drug prohibition is chaos. The government gave violent criminals and organized crime control of certain drugs. Lack of quality control increases overdose deaths; sales to minors and facilitates a violent black market where an open free market would end that violence.
<br>
<br>
If it was physically possible to apprehend every lawbreaker next week, the economy and society would come to a screeching halt. There's already anarchy (massive lawlessness), might as well have chaos to go with it?
<br>
<br>
Thomas Jefferson wasn't perfect -- nobody is. But he was spot on target with this:
<br>
 "No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another, and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him." --Thomas Jefferson to Francis Gilmer, 1816.
<br>
<br>
Incrementalism moves toward chaos. How much incrementalism is just the right amount? What is the destination of incrementalism? What constitutes or defines a reasonable person?
<br>
<br>
A reasonable person doesn't commit theft, assault, rape murder or threat's thereof. A reasonable person doesn't initiate force, threat of force or fraud against any person or their property.
<br>
<br>
Politicians and bureaucrats won't be able to keep up much longer. Certainly not using lies, spin and deceptions -- irrationalities -- they've relied on for several decades. Oversight groups within organizations like the Foresight Institute, the Lifeboat Foundation and other futurist orgs know this and have been researching, developing and implementing plans to assist government officials in the transition. The transition from irrational to rational. 
<br>
<br>
Government officials have over regulated almost every field and industry. There's no way they'll be able to keep up with exponential advancing technology. Increasingly more industries and technologies will have oversight and regulation from within each respective industry. And or Underwriter's Laboratory type businesses. Leaving government to increasingly narrow its focus to its primary responsibility -- protecting the citizens' life and property from the initiation of force, threat of force and fraud.
<br>
<br>
Government will have little if any time or purpose to regulate human enhancement technologies. Exponential advancing technology also applies to making the most effective form of government. That too will occur with speed beyond what linear thinking would comprehend.</p></td>
