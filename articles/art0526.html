<div class="TeaserText">The elusive goal of creating a photorealistic synthespian indistinguishable from a live actor has intrigued, taunted and tormented programmers for 30 years. We're 90 percent there, but efforts so far have failed to convey convincing nuances of facial expression, micro-motion, light, and texture. The exciting areas to be explored are those where the animator becomes analogous to the actor in a medium free of the constraints of live action photography...creating characters, roles, and plots that exploit our intimate familiarity with the human form and its subtleties, but don't attempt to recreate photorealistic renderings of it. </div>

<p>The anthropomorphization of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics has been a classic 
              case of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> powered by <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, commerce 
              and culture. Funding for <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and aerospace applications like 
              nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s design, weather prediction and flight simulation 
              paid for much of the initial heavy lifting required to build the 
              foundation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics industry during the 1960's and 
              early 1970's.</p>
<p>As the sophistication of graphics <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> marched forward and 
              the cost of computing slid downward, the annual SIGGRAPH film and 
              video show became the crucible in which technologists, filmmakers 
              and artists were introduced to one another: the baton of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              graphics design was passed from those who wrote the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s required 
              to create imagery to those who perceived and exploited the incredible 
              communicative potential of this fledgling medium.</p>
<p>Along the way, the natural predilection to create <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics 
              in the image of ourselves has led to a striking body of creative 
              endeavor, ever growing in realism and resolution, which now knocks 
              at the door of imperceptibility; that is, the rendering of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              performances indistinguishable from flesh and blood performances. 
              Some of the steps in that <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> are traced here from a personal 
              perspective, and some speculations on <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments are presented. 
            </p>
<p>Initial attempts at simulating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> took several forms 
              at <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Effects, a company I co-founded in 1978 along with college 
              associates. Hierarchical skeletons were created and keyframe-animated 
              to move in a bipedal fashion, but without any IK (inverse kinematics) 
              solutions available, the results were stilted and difficult to edit. 
              Rotoscoping live-<a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> footage of a subject festooned with witness 
              points at the joints and digitizing the positing of the points on 
              film allowed us to imbue our characters with more lifelike <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, 
              but the process yielded primarily 2-D <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that could not 
              be used from all angles. </p>
<p>At that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 3-D modeling <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> had been designed for architectural 
              applications and was not capable of modeling the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> form in a 
              satisfactory manner. Early attempts at creating and linking facial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s using <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> solutions in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> animation were 
              very disappointing and unconvincing at even the most <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> levels 
              of lip synchronization.</p>
<p>3-D rotoscoping at Robert Abel and Associates yielded the first 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>-captured animation in the <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> project, <i>Sexy <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">Robot</a></i>, 
              under the technical direction of Frank Vitz, who used two 35mm cameras 
              to triangulate the 3-D positions of witness points on a live subject.

<p>During the period of 1985-1986, a good deal of seminal <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              and development in character animation was conducted at Abel as 
              well as <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Productions and Omnibus <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Graphics, all three 
              of which joined together and imploded under the weight of their 
              largesse.</p>
<h3><b>First Synthespian</b></h3>
<p>While at <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a>-Omnibus-Abel (to become known as DOA) I met Diana 
              Walczak, a recent college graduate who was <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for ways to 
              combine <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>. We formed a partnership based on our mutual 
              interest in developing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-generated characters and came up 
              with sculpture-based solutions to the problem of modeling the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              form and creating facial animation. </p>
<p>Diana sculpted a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> form in clay and metal armature that was 
              cast in hydrocal, from which <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> body parts could be created 
              and digitized using a magnetic digitizing <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> called the 3Space 
              Digitizer by Polhemus. The body parts were lined with thin tape 
              to define the optimum topology in polygons and digitized by hand 
              using a magnetic sensor. </p>
<p><img align="right" height="134" hspace="10" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223926im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/Images/sextone.gif" vspace="8" width="130">These 
              body parts were then assembled <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly into a skeletal <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> 
              to form Nestor Sextone, our first Synthespian. Nestor's joints were 
              formed by interpenetrating solids-due to the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              did not yet exist that would allow for flexors at the joints-which 
              gave us seams similar to that of a plastic <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> figure. For facial 
              animation, a neutral face was cast in hydrocal, which allowed Diana 
              to make multiple clay copies that could be sculpted into various 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/phoneme_entry.html">phoneme</a>s of speech and facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s.</p>
<p>Larry Weinberg, a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mer from <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Effects and Omnibus who 
              later would write Poser, contributed <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that would allow us 
              to link the various digitized facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s together by re-ordering 
              the polygons. With multiple faces re-ordered into exactly the same 
              polygonal topology, we could interpolate from one to another, enabling 
              us to create scripts that could simulate lip synchronization with 
              our soundtracks. Using keyframe animation and Larry's facial animation 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, Sextone made his screen debut for SIGGRAPH 1988 in a film 
              of 30 seconds duration in which he campaigns for the presidency 
              of the Synthetic Actors Guild. </p>
<p><img align="right" height="258" hspace="10" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223926im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/dozo.jpg" width="180">Intrigued 
              by the potential of <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> to link natural <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> 
              to our synthetic characters, we created <i>Don't Touch Me</i>, a 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> video piece that premiered at SIGGRAPH 1990 in which singer/songwriter 
              Perla Batalla was optically <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a>d (by <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">Motion</a> Analysis 
              in Santa Rosa, CA) to drive a singing synthespian called Dozo. By 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, we had suitable flexing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for simple joints like 
              elbows and knees, but the multi-axis requirements for the shoulder 
              joint meant a solution was still several months of development away.</p>
<p>Facial animation was again created by linking digitized sculptures 
              of various facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s and this technique yielded superior 
              results to any of the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> solutions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that sought 
              to model the musculature of the face. <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> solutions would require 
              many years of development before they would overcome the quality 
              and believability of the sculpture-based technique, which allowed 
              for the preservation of facial volume and the illusion of the preservation 
              of facial muscle integrity during <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>.</p>

<p><i>Walczak first created a clay sculpture with a neutral

<p> This is the result of the fact that Diana's keyframe sculptures

              live dancers, we created the illusion of glass synthespians dancing 
              on a hovering beach that floated over the audience. </p>
<p>Since we used ray tracing to refract the background through the 
              bodies of the dancers, the stereoscopic image perceived by the audience 
              was accurately rendered with slightly different refractions from 
              the point of view of the left eye as compared to the right, yielding 
              a very realistic illusion reminiscent of the optical properties

              chase sequence required Sylvester Stallone and Rob Schneider to 
              appear to ride on a flying motorcycle that weaves around other flying 
              vehicles and skyscrapers. The close-ups were shot on a green screen 
              stage with a gimbaled prop of the motorcycle and composited into 
              mocon (<a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> control) footage of the huge model of the city. Other 
              shots required the motorcycle to fly toward camera from a long distance 
              and maneuver in a complex flight path as it whizzed past camera. 
            </p>
<p>These shots were not able to be photographed due to limitations 
              in the length of the green-screen camera rig as well as the reluctance 
              of the producers to allow a large, heavy, <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>-controlled camera

              The way her body moved in response to the <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the bike was 
              captured and applied to photoreal synthetic versions of Stallone

<h3>Organic shape-shifting</h3>
            A later project for the feature film <i>X-Men</i> involved the character 
            Mystique, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Mystique is a shape-shifter 
            who transforms from her scaly blue form into other characters and 
            back again using a combination of live <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> photography and CG animation. 
            Director Bryan Singer was looking for a transformation that would 
            stand apart from the typical morphing that had risen like a plague 
            through the visual arts, becoming a constant technique used in <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a> 
            and in films to change one <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> into another using simultaneous 
            2D shape transformation with dissolving texture vertices. 
            <p align="center"><img height="295" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223926im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/mystique.jpg" width="180"></p>
<p>We designed a technique that would allow for a dimensional transformation 
              that would begin at various locations and spread across and around 
              the limbs in an organic, infectious fashion accented by 3-D scales 
              bursting through the surface and settling down like a shaking dog's 
              coat to form the scales on her body. In most cases we used CyberScan 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> of the outgoing actor matched to the 3-D position of the actor 
              in the shot as a matting <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a> to transform into an all-CG Mystique. 
            </p>
<p>This technique required eighteen stages of production to create 
              the multilayered complex transformation and very careful matching 
              of CG skin, clothing and hair to the live <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> footage. Although 
              the mandate was to make the CG Mystique appear photoreal, her blue, 
              scaly body was very different from that of a normal person, yielding 
              considerable visual leeway</p>
<p>For the Revolution Films production of the Jet Li film, <i>The 
              One</i>, Jet Li battles his identical doppelganger from another 
              dimension. For many shots, a simple split screen or a Patty Duke-style 
              over- the-shoulder shot would suffice, but for high-speed kung fu 
              battle sequences in which punches and kicks had to land and be felt 
              by the audience, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> face replacement was the technique of choice.</p>
<p>The separation of a facial performance from a physical performance 
              had been accomplished before in <i>Jurassic Park</i> in the shot 
              where the velociraptor leaps up from below to attack a child character. 
            </p>
<p>The adult stunt double's face was replaced with that of the child 
              actor, but that was simply a composite of photographic <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s. 
              In <i>The One</i>, the complex high-speed <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> of the subjects 
              during the fight sequences-coupled with the requirement that the 
              two subjects sometimes appear to move at different camera frame 
              rates-required us to develop a fully CG face-replacement solution.</p>
<p>The stunt double, a kung fu expert with a very similar body type 
              to Jet Li, was outfitted with a plastic mask that was milled from 
              a CyberScan of Jet Li's face. The mask was equipped with retro-reflective 
              witness points and the camera was outfitted with a fluorescent, 
              circular <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> around the lens to ensure that the markers would 
              show up on film. </p>

<p>The fight sequences were choreographed so that the force of the 
              impacts would impart proper reaction in the two participants. Using 
              the known positions of the facemask markers, we could determine 
              the precise orientation of the stunt double's face on each frame, 
              allowing us to track a CG face over top of his mask. </p>
<p>Using CyberScan <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> of Jet's face, along with high-resolution 
              photographs, we created and rigged a detailed 3-D Jet Li face with 
              blendshapes that would allow us to simulate different facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>s 
              during the fight. The CG face was then animated to give us the appropriate 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> for each sequence, matted into the shot covering up the 
              mask and blended into the stunt double's natural color around the 
              face. Because it was not possible to photograph Li's face in the 
              proper dynamic orientation with the proper <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> for a given 
              moment of a fight, a CG face was the only solution. </p>
<p>The resulting <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which allows us to separate the physical 
              performance from the facial performance, has far-reaching implications 
              for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of filmmaking. First of all, stunt sequences that 
              normally would be staged in such a way that the face of the stunt 
              double is never facing camera can now be staged according to the 
              needs of the director, and the actor's face can be inserted accurately 
              and believably. More broadly, the facial performance of an actor 
              who is incapable of the physical aspects of a performance can be 
              composited into the footage of a stunt double to multiply the range 
              of an actor's possible roles. Recent projects making use of our 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> include inserting an actor's face onto stunt doubles 
              who are surfing and riding motorcycles. 
            <h3><b>Animation trumps mo-cap</b></h3>
<p>More interesting from our standpoint is the creation of wholly 
              CG characters and their application to <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> projects. Universal 
              Studios came to us with the mandate to create the best theme park 
              attraction in the world based on the Spider-Man characters, and 
              we spent three years in production on <i>The Amazing Adventures

<p>Working with our head <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> designer, Frank Vitz, we developed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that would compensate for the viewing position of the moving 
              audience, who would sit in six degrees-of-<a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/simulator_entry.html">simulator</a>s 
              traveling on a track past 13 large reflective screens. The imagery 
              was projected in stereoscopic eight-perf 70mm film. </p>
<p>A great deal of attention was paid to matching the physical sets 
              in the ride to the imagery projected onto the screens so that the 
              lines were blurred between the real world and the virtual, projected 
              world. In fact, many of the sets adjacent to the screens were dressed 
              with CG textures that originated from our virtual sets and were 
              scanned onto eight-foot-wide canvas murals so that imagery and sight 
              lines would match up and blend the two worlds into one. </p>
<p>From a design standpoint, our goal was to take the audience into 
              a comic book world that combines the hard key-lighting and saturated-color 
              style of comic <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> with enough textural detail to feel like a real 
              place. It was a balancing act between stylization and realism that 
              resulted in a unique and exciting environment in which to stage 
              the epic struggle between Spider-Man and a gaggle of super-villains 
              led by Dr. Octopus, one that swirls around the audience whom Spider-Man 
              must protect. </p>
<p>We tested and abandoned <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a> for the project based on 
              the fact that the superhuman performances of the Marvel characters 
              could be better realized by talented animators using keyframe techniques 
              rather than by animators trying to extend the physical range of

              keyframed character animation instead of <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_capture_entry.html">motion capture</a>, which often

<p><b>The limits of photorealism</b></p>
<p>Looking to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, one must examine one's goals in creating 
              CG <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms. There are those who hold up photorealism as the ultimate 
              goal: to create a synthespian indistinguishable from a live actor. 
              This idea has intrigued, taunted and tormented <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers for 30 
              years, going back to the films <i>Westworld</i> in 1973 and <i>Looker</i> 
              in 1981. The broad base of development required to accomplish this 
              feat has been gaining momentum at an exponential rate as more applications, 
              competition and funding enter the arena. </p>
<p>There exists a trade-off between what level of realism is possible 
              versus how much computing <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> can be spent on each frame. We supplied 
              very efficient body <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>s to <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223926/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/memelist.html?m=9" target="_top">Ramona</a></i>

<p>The performance was designed within the limitations of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>,

              a liability in terms of image quality. As the camera approaches 
              the subject, the resolution requirements skyrocket, and to render 
              a photorealistic close-up on film requires orders of magnitude more

<p>As Ray points out, computing speeds are increasing at exponential 
              rates, but current <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> still gets slammed to the mat when 
              it is applied to creating a synthespian who appears real in every 
              detail. The problem is that we spend so much of our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> studying 
              the nuances of facial <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> in our colleagues, friends and 
              family, so we have become quite expert at spotting flaws. There 
              are many subtle details in a real face, including how the complex 
              muscle <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> perturbs the skin surface, how <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> scatters inside

              look and react to <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. </p>
<p>A spectacular amount of money was poured into solving these problems 
              in the all-CG feature film <i>Final Fantasy: the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a>s Within</i> 
              and the results did not pay off at the box office. Many projects

              is not yet ready for this task, and many of us cringe at the prospect 
              of this sort of application. The recent release of <i>S1m0ne</i> 
              reiterates the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> problem these sorts of projects face: we can 
              get about 90 percent of the way to photorealism in CG actors, but 
              the last ten percent is extremely expensive and <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>-consuming in 
              comparison to photographing real actors. </p>

<p>In <i>Final Fantasy</i>, the hair, skin, cloth <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> and lighting 
              are all in that 95% range that just doesn't make it to photoreality, 
              except in stills. In <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>, the illusion lacks the subtlety of 
              micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> and micro-detail of live <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> photography, and the 
              results are unsettling and distracting from the storyline. </p>
<p>In <i>Simone</i>, the producers opted to use a live actor who was 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly altered to be just slightly idealized through <a class="thought" href="entries/image_processing_entry.html">image processing</a>. 
              Coupled with a few shots of a CyberScanned 3-D model being revealed 
              like an orange peel wipe-on, the processed footage told the story 
              adequately and carried the story point of a believable CG <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              cost-effectively.</p>
<p><img align="right" height="133" hspace="6" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011223926im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/simone_6668F.jpg" width="200">To 
              have used a CG character throughout would have been many times more 
              costly and it is unlikely that the audience would believe that the 
              CG character could be mistaken for a real actor. Albeit a valiant 
              attempt, the film presumes a mythical world where Hollywood producers 
              and the general public have no <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              of visual effects, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> animation and <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> compositing. </p>
<h3>Animator as actor </h3>
            The exciting areas to be explored are those where the animator becomes 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the actor. By animators using a robust <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of tools and 
            techniques, performances of the quality and richness currently created 
            by the finest actors will be made possible in a medium free of the 
            <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s of live-<a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> photography. These will be characters, 
            roles, and plots that exploit our intimate familiarity with the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
            form and its subtleties, but don't attempt to recreate photorealistic 
            renderings of it. 
            <p>When painters developed the skills to recreate realistic images, 
              a golden era of realism followed. But when photography came along 
              and replaced the role of the painter as visual documentarian, painters 
              responded with <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a>ism and <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a>, modes of image-making 
              only possible in the era of post-realism. </p>
<p>In the same way, after the CG industry is able to reproduce <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              in its most intricate detail, the next step will be to build upon 
              that foundation a new and exciting <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of non-realistic style. 
              But rather than being limited to the confines of a painted canvas 
              or a physical sculpture, the realm of <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a> becomes the only 
              outer limit. </p>
<p>Beyond the capability to achieve photorealism, there is a much 
              more compelling goal of creating <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> that takes place 
              beyond what and where we can photograph. The writer and director 
              are now the creative overlords, equipped with unlimited theatrical 
              possibilities in terms of locations, characters, storylines and 
              visual style. The entire world of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> and fantasy-based 
              literature can be shot "on location" without limitation. 
              New stories heretofore inconceivable will be created and brought 
              to the world of the visual arts and <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>. </p>
<p>In this work, the emphasis will be on the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>. The writer and 
              director stand at the door of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> that has thus far been 
              explored by precious few&#8212;and marvel at the possibilities.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Certainly 3D animation and modeling has come a long way since the days of Luxor Jr. I agree completely that the only thing holding back the first true photorealistic cg thespian is quality of animation. 
<br>
<br>
The characters in Final Fantasy, albeit very real looking in stills, seemed too stiff as they moved around. If you would like to see a cg artist who takes the photorealistic still to the next level please look at the following link: 
<br>
http://www.raph.com/3dartists/artgallery/ag-ap295.html
<br>
<br>
I was curious what would be a proper way to combat the issue of badly articulating CG models? MO-Cap obviously doesn't get the job done correctly even though it is taken directly from life. What about hand animation? If Pixar were to animate a photorealistic model would they be able to correctly animate the subtle nuances?
<br>
<br>
Thank You,

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Aye, I agree there as far as the animation is concerned.  About the only thing that was really wrong there was, well, the "Hair" enigma lol.  All of the models hair didn't move, which really showed me how utterly we take some things for granted.  The simple matter of the Hair not moving really threw the rest of the character off.  Solve that and you're off to the races.  Another thing to consider also before we integrate humans into this environment, is the problem of "simulator sickness"; keep in mind that there is a very real physiological state to deal with.</p></td>
