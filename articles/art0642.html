<div class="TeaserText">Why is the universe life-friendly? Columbia physicist Brian Greene says it's the deepest question in all of science. Cosmologist Paul Davies agrees, calling it the biggest of the Big Questions. </div>
<br>
<br> <p><i>This is a transcript of a lecture originally delivered at Hayden 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">Planet</a>arium, as part of the "Distinguished Authors in <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">Astronomy</a>" 
              lecture series. Reprinted on KurzweilAI.net February 10, 2006.</i></p>
<p>It is, in the view of Columbia physicist Brian Greene, the deepest 
              question in all of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Renowned cosmologist Paul Davies agrees, 
              calling it the biggest of the Big Questions.</p>
<p> And just what is this momentous question?</p>
<p> Not the mystery of life&#8217;s origin, though the profundity of 
              that particular puzzle prompted <a class="thought" href="entries/darwin_entry.html">Charles Darwin</a> to remark that it 
              was probably forever beyond the pale of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> comprehension. A dog, 
              Darwin commented famously, might as easily contemplate the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> 
              of Newton.</p>
<p> Not the inscrutable manner in which <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> emerges from 
              the interaction and interconnection of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s in the human skull, 
              though a cascade of Nobel prizes will undoubtedly reward the teams 
              of neuroscientists who achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in understanding this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>.</p>
<p> And not even the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> course of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> and cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> 
              on planet <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>, though the great Darwinian river is surely carving 
              a course that today&#8217;s most <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> evolutionary theorist 
              will have difficulty even imagining.</p>
<p> No, the question is more profound, more fundamental, less tractable 
              than any of these. It is this&#8212;why is the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-friendly?</p>
<p> Life-friendly, you might ask incredulously? The universe is <i>life-friendly</i>? 
              The heck it is!</p>
<p> We have been taught since childhood that the universe is a horrifyingly 
              hostile place. Violent <a class="thought" href="entries/black_hole_entry.html">black hole</a>s, planets and moons searing with 
              unbearable heat or deep-frozen at temperatures that make Antarctica 
              look tropical, and the vastness of interstellar <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> dooming us 
              to perpetual physical isolation from our nearest starry neighbors&#8212;this 
              is the depressing picture of the cosmos beyond Earth that dominates 
              the popular <a class="thought" href="entries/imagination_entry.html">imagination</a>.</p>
<p> This vision is profoundly wrong at a fundamental level. As scientists 
              are now beginning to realize to their astonishment, the truly amazing 
              thing about our universe is how strangely and improbably life-friendly 
              or anthropic it is. As Cambridge evolutionary biologist Simon Conway 
              Morris puts it in his new book <i>Life&#8217;s Solution</i>, &#8220;On 
              a cosmic scale, it is now widely appreciated that even trivial differences 
              in the starting conditions [of the cosmos] would lead to an unrecognizable 
              and uninhabitable universe.&#8221;</p>
<p> Simply put, if the Big Bang had detonated with slightly greater 
              force, the cosmos would be essentially empty by now. If the primordial 
              explosion had propelled the initial payload of cosmic raw materials 
              outward with slightly lesser force, the universe would long ago 
              have recollapsed in a <a class="thought" href="entries/big_crunch_entry.html">Big Crunch</a>. In neither case would human beings 
              or other life forms have had <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to evolve.</p>
<p> As <a class="thought" href="entries/hawking_entry.html">Stephen Hawking</a> asks, &#8220;Why is the universe so close to 
              the dividing line between collapsing again and expanding indefinitely? 
              In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to be as close as we are now, the rate of expansion early 
              on had to be chosen fantastically accurately.&#8221; </p>
<p> It is not only the rate of cosmic expansion that appears to have 
              been selected, with phenomenal precision, in order to render our 
              universe fit for <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>-based life and the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              A multitude of other factors are fine-tuned with fantastic exactitude 
              to a degree that renders the cosmos almost spookily bio-friendly. 
              Some of the universe&#8217;s life-friendly <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s include the 
              odd proclivity of stellar nucleosynthesis&#8212;the process by which 
              simple <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s like <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> and helium are transmuted into heavier 
              elements in the hearts of giant supernovae&#8212;to yield copious 
              quantities of carbon, the chemical epicenter of life as we know 
              it.</p>
<p> As British astronomer Fred Hoyle pointed out, in order for carbon 
              to exist in the abundant quantities that we observe throughout the 
              cosmos, the mechanism of stellar nucleosynthesis must be exquisitely 
              fine-tuned in a very special way.</p>
<p> Yet another bio-friendly feature of the cosmos is the physical 
              dimensionality of our universe: why are there just three extended 
              dimensions of space rather one or two or even the ten spatial dimensions 
              contemplated by M-theory? As has been known for more than a century, 
              in any other dimensional setup, stable planetary orbits would be 
              impossible and life would not have time to get started before planets 
              skittered off into deep space or plunged into their suns.</p>
<p> For centuries, it seemed that the dimensionality of the universe&#8212;three 
              dimensions of space plus one dimension of time&#8212;was a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> 
              of axiomatic truth. Rather like the propositions of <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>. In 
              fact, precisely like the propositions of geometry. That was before 
              the birth of superstring theory, and its successor, M-theory. I 
              am going to get into M-theory more deeply in a moment but for now 
              I want to highlight its insistence on the fact that there are, in 
              fact, <i>ten</i> dimensions of space and one dimension of time. 
              The mystery is why only three of the spatial dimensions got inflated 
              into cosmic proportions by the Big Bang while the remaining seven 
              stayed inconceivably minuscule. If anything else had happened&#8212;if 
              only two spatial dimensions had been inflated or if four had been 
              inflated&#8212;then the universe would not have been <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up to allow 
              the emergence of life and mind as we know them.</p>
<p> Collectively, this stunning set of coincidences render the universe 
              eerily fit for life and intelligence. And the coincidences are built 
              into the fundamental fabric of our <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>. As British Astronomer 
              Royal Sir Martin Rees says, &#8220;There are deep connections between 
              stars and atoms, between the cosmos and the microworld . . . . Our 
              emergence and survival depend on very special &#8216;tuning&#8217; 
              of the cosmos.&#8221; Or, as the eminent Princeton physicist John 
              Wheeler put it, &#8220;It is not only that man is adapted to the 
              universe. The universe is adapted to man. Imagine a universe in 
              which one or another of the fundamental dimensionless constants 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> is altered by a few percent one way or the other? Man 
              could never come into being in such a universe.&#8221;</p>
<p> Scientists have been aware of this set of puzzles for decades 
              and have given it name&#8212;the anthropic cosmological principle&#8212;but 
              there is a new urgency to the quest for a plausible explanation 
              because of two very recent discoveries&#8212;the first at <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>&#8217;s 
              largest scale and the second at its tiniest.</p>
<p> The first was the discovery of dark <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, which resulted from 
              the observations of supernovae at extreme distances. Contrary to 
              all expectations, the evidence showed that the expansion of the 
              universe was speeding up, not slowing down. No one knows what is 
              causing this phenomenon, although speculative explanations like 
              leakage of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> into extra unseen dimensions are beginning to 
              show up in the scientific literature.</p>
<p> But for our purposes, what is particularly puzzling is why the 
              strength of dark energy&#8212;which the new Wilkinson microwave probe 
              has revealed to be the predominant constituent of our cosmos&#8212;is 
              so vanishingly small, yet not quite zero. If it were even a tad 
              stronger, you see, the universe would have been emptied long ago, 
              scrubbed clean of stars and galaxies well before life and intelligence 
              could evolve.</p>
<p> The second discovery occurred in the realm of M-theory, whose 
              previous incarnation was known as superstring theory. Those of you 
              who have read Brian Greene&#8217;s terrific book <i>The Elegant Universe</i> 
              or watched the Nova series based on it will know that M-theory posits 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s like quarks, <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/neutrino_entry.html">neutrino</a>s are 
              really just different modes of vibration of tiny one-dimensional 
              strings of energy. But what is truly strange about M-theory is that 
              it allows a vast landscape of possible vibration modes of superstrings, 
              only a tiny fraction of which correspond to anything like the sub-atomic 
              particle world we observe and that is described by what is known 
              as the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>
<p> Just how big is this landscape of possible alternative models 
              of particle physics allowed by M-theory? According to Stanford physicist 
              and superstring pioneer Leonard Susskind, the mathematical landscape 
              is horrifyingly gigantic, permitting 10<sup>500</sup> power different and distinct 
              environments, none of which appears to be mathematically favored, 
              let alone foreordained by the theory. And in virtually none of those 
              other mathematically permissible environments would matter and energy 
              have possessed the qualities that are necessary for stars, galaxies 
              and carbon-based living creatures to have emerged from the primordial 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>.</p>
<p> This is, as Susskind says, an intellectual cataclysm of the first 
              magnitude because it seems to deprive our most promising new theory 
              of fundamental physics&#8212;M-theory&#8212;of the power to uniquely 
              predict the emergence of anything remotely resembling our universe. 
              As Susskind puts it, the picture of the universe that is emerging 
              from the deep mathematical recesses of M-theory is not an &#8220;elegant 
              universe&#8221; at all! It&#8217;s a Rube Goldberg <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, cobbled 
              together by some unknown process in a supremely improbable manner 
              that just happens to render the whole ensemble miraculously fit 
              for life. In the words of University of California theoretical physicist 
              Steve Giddings, &#8220;No longer can we follow the <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of discovering 
              the unique equations that predict everything we see, and writing 
              them on a single page.&#8221; Or a tee-shirt! &#8220;Predicting the 
              constants of nature becomes a messy environmental problem. It has 
              the complications of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>.&#8221; Note the key word Giddings uses&#8212;&#8220;biology&#8221;&#8212;because 
              we will be coming back to it shortly.</p>
<p> This really is, as Brian Greene says, the deepest problem in all 
              of science. It really is, as Paul Davies says, the biggest of the 
              Big Questions: why is the universe life-friendly?</p>
<p> If we put to one side theological approaches to this ultimate 
              issue, what rational pathways forward are on offer from the scientific 
              community? I suggest that three <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> approaches are available. 
              Two are familiar while the third is radically <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a>.</p>
<p> The first approach is to continue <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing patiently for a unique 
              final theory&#8212;something that you really could write on your 
              tee-shirt like E = mc<sup>2</sup>&#8212;which might yet, against the odds, emerge 
              from M-theory or one of its competitors (like loop quantum gravity) 
              aspiring to the status of a so-called &#8220;theory of everything.&#8221; 
              This is the fond hope of virtually every professional theoretical 
              physicist, including those who have been driven to desperation by 
              the horrendously messy and complex landscape of theoretically possible 
              M-theory-allowed universes that distresses Susskind and other superstring 
              theorists. Perhaps the laws and constants of nature&#8212;an ensemble 
              the late New York Academy of Sciences president and physicist Heinz 
              Pagels dubbed the cosmic code&#8212;will, in the end, turn out to 
              be uniquely specified by <a class="thought" href="entries/mathematics_entry.html">mathematics</a> and thus subject to no conceivable 
              variation. Perhaps the ultimate equations will someday slide out 
              of the mind of a new <a class="thought" href="entries/colossus_entry.html">colossus</a> of physics as slickly and beautifully 
              as E = mc<sup>2</sup> emerged from Einstein&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Perhaps, but that 
              appears to be an increasingly unlikely prospect.</p>
<p> A second approach, born of desperation on the part of Susskind 
              and others, is to overlay a refinement of Big Bang <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> theory 
              called eternal chaotic inflation with an explanatory approach that 
              has been traditionally reviled by most scientists which is known 
              as the weak anthropic principle. The weak anthropic principle merely 
              states in tautological fashion that since human observers inhabit 
              this particular universe, it must perforce be life-friendly or it 
              would not contain any observers resembling ourselves. Eternal chaotic 
              inflation, invented by Russian-born physicist Andrei Linde, asserts 
              that instead of just one Big Bang there are, always have been, and 
              always will be, zillions of Big Bangs going off in inaccessible 
              regions all the time. These Big Bangs create zillions of new universes 
              constantly and the whole ensemble constitutes a <a class="thought" href="entries/multiverse_entry.html">multiverse</a>.</p>
<p> Now here&#8217;s what happens when these two ideas&#8212;eternal 
              chaotic inflation and the weak anthropic principle&#8212;are joined 
              together. In each Big Bang, the laws, constants and the physical 
              dimensionality of nature come out differently. In some, dark energy 
              is stronger. In some, dark energy is weaker. In some, gravity is 
              stronger. In some, gravity is weaker. This happens, according to 
              M-theory-based <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>, because the 10-dimensional physical shapes 
              in which superstrings vibrate&#8212;known as Calabi-Yau shapes&#8212;evolve 
              randomly and chaotically at the moment of each new Big Bang. The 
              laws and constants of nature are constantly reshuffled by this process, 
              like a cosmic deck of cards.</p>
<p> And here&#8217;s the crucial part. Once in a blue moon, this random 
              process of eternal chaotic inflation will yield a winning hand, 
              as judged from the perspective of whether a particular new universe 
              is life-friendly. That outcome will be pure chance&#8212;one lucky 
              roll of the dice in an unimaginably vast cosmic crap shoot with 
              10<sup>500</sup> unfavorable outcomes for every winning turn.</p>
<p> Our universe was a big winner, of course, in the cosmic lottery. 
              Our cosmos was dealt a royal flush. Here is how the eminent Nobel 
              laureate Steve Weinberg explained this scenario in a <i>New York 
              Review of Books</i> essay a couple of years ago: &#8220;The expanding 
              cloud of billions of galaxies that we call the big bang may be just 
              one fragment of a much larger universe in which big bangs go off 
              all the time, each one with different values for the fundamental 
              constants.&#8221; It is no more a mystery that our particular branch 
              of the multiverse exhibits life-friendly characteristics, according 
              to Weinberg, than that life evolved on the hospitable Earth &#8220;rather 
              than some horrid place, like Mercury or Pluto.&#8221;</p>
<p> If you find this scenario unsatisfactory&#8212;the weak anthropic 
              principle superimposed on Andrei Linde&#8217;s theory of eternal 
              chaotic inflation&#8212;I can assure you that you are not alone. 
              To most scientists, offering the tautological explanation that since 
              human observers inhabit this particular universe, it must necessarily 
              be life-friendly or else it would not contain any observers resembling 
              ourselves is anathema. It just sounds like giving up. </p>
<p> In my view, there are two primary problems with the Weinberg/Susskind 
              approach. First, universes spawned by Big Bangs other than our own 
              are inaccessible from our own universe, at least with the <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al 
              techniques currently available to scientists. So the approach appears 
              to be untestable, perhaps untestable in principle. And testability 
              is the hallmark of genuine science, distinguishing it from fields 
              of inquiry like <a class="thought" href="entries/metaphysics_entry.html">metaphysics</a> and theology.</p>
<p> Second, the Weinberg/Susskind approach extravagantly violates 
              the mediocrity principle. The mediocrity principle, a mainstay of 
              scientific theorizing since Copernicus, is a statistically based 
              rule of thumb that, absent contrary evidence, a particular sample 
              (Earth, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, or our particular universe) should be assumed 
              to be a typical example of the ensemble of which it is a part. The 
              Weinberg/Susskind approach flagrantly flouts the mediocrity principle. 
              Instead, their approach simply takes refuge in a brute, unfathomable 
              mystery&#8212;the conjectured lucky roll of the dice in a crap game 
              of eternal chaotic inflation&#8212;and declines to probe seriously 
              into the possibility of a naturalistic cosmic evolutionary process 
              that has the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to yield a life-friendly set of physical laws 
              and constants on a nonrandom basis. It is as if Charles Darwin, 
              contemplating the famous tangled bank (the arresting visual image 
              with which he concludes <i>The Origin of <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">Species</a></i>), had confessed 
              not a magnificent obsession with gaining an understanding of the 
              mysterious natural processes that had yielded &#8220;endless forms 
              most beautiful and most wonderful,&#8221; but rather a smug satisfaction 
              that <i>of course</i> the earthly <a class="thought" href="entries/biosphere_entry.html">biosphere</a> must have somehow evolved 
              in a just-so manner mysteriously friendly to humans and other currently 
              living species, or else Darwin and other humans would not be around 
              to contemplate it!</p>
<p> Indeed, the situation that confronts cosmologists today is eerily 
              reminiscent of that which faced biologists before Charles Darwin 
              propounded his revolutionary theory of evolution. Darwin confronted 
              the seemingly miraculous phenomenon of a fine-tuned natural order 
              in which every creature and plant appeared to occupy a unique and 
              well-designed niche. Refusing to surrender to the brute mystery 
              posed by the appearance of nature&#8217;s design, Darwin masterfully 
              deployed the <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> of metaphor to elucidate a radical <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>&#8212;the 
              origin of species through natural selection&#8212;that explained 
              the apparent miracle as a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p> The metaphor furnished by the familiar process of artificial selection 
              was Darwin&#8217;s crucial stepping stone. Indeed, the practice of 
              <i>artificial</i> selection through plant and <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> breeding was 
              the primary intellectual model that guided Darwin in his quest to 
              solve the mystery of the origin of species and to demonstrate in 
              principle the plausibility of his theory that variation and natural 
              selection were the prime movers responsible for the phenomenon of 
              speciation. So, too, today a few venturesome cosmologists have begun 
              to use the same poetic tool utilized by Darwin&#8212;the art of metaphorical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>&#8212;to develop novel intellectual models that might offer 
              a logical explanation for what appears to be an unfathomable mystery: 
              the apparent fine-tuning of the cosmos.</p>
<p> The cosmological metaphor chosen by these iconoclastic theorists 
              is life itself. What if life, they ask in the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> the great Belgian 
              biologist and Nobel laureate Christian de Duve, were not a cosmic 
              accident but the essential reality at the very heart of the elegant 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry of the universe? What if Darwin&#8217;s principle of natural 
              selection were merely a tiny <a class="thought" href="entries/fractal_entry.html">fractal</a> embodiment of a universal life-giving 
              principle that drives the evolution of stars, galaxies, and the 
              cosmos itself?</p>
<p> This, as you may have guessed, is the headline summarizing the 
              third (and radically novel) approach to answering the biggest of 
              the Big Questions: why is the universe life-friendly? It is the 
              approach outlined at length in my new book <i>BIOCOSM</i>.</p>
<p> Before I get into this third approach in more detail, I want to 
              say something upfront about scientific speculation. The approach 
              I am about to outline for you is intentionally and forthrightly 
              speculative. Following the example of Darwin, I have attempted to 
              crudely frame a radically new explanatory <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> well before all 
              of the required building materials and construction tools are at 
              hand. Darwin had not the slightest clue, for instance, that <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> 
              is the molecular device used by all life-forms on Earth to accomplish 
              the feat of what he called &#8220;inheritance.&#8221; Indeed, as <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> 
              biologist Kenneth R. Miller noted in <i>Finding Darwin&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a></i>, 
              &#8220;Charles Darwin worked in almost total ignorance of the fields 
              we now call <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a>, cell biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry.&#8221; 
              Nonetheless, Darwin managed to put forward a plausible theoretical 
              framework that succeeded magnificently despite the fact that it 
              was utterly dependent on hypothesized but completely unknown mechanisms 
              of genetic transmission.</p>
<p> As Darwin&#8217;s example shows, plausible and deliberate speculation 
              plays an essential role in the advancement of science. Speculation 
              is the means by which new scientific paradigms are initially constructed, 
              to be either abandoned later as wrong-headed detours or vindicated 
              as the seeds of scientific revolutions.</p>
<p> Another <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant lesson drawn from Darwin&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> is 
              important to note at the outset. Answering the question of why the 
              most eminent geologists and naturalists had, until shortly before 
              publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, disbelieved in the 
              mutability of species, Darwin responded that this false conclusion 
              was &#8220;almost inevitable as long as the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the world 
              was <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to be of short duration.&#8221; It was geologist Charles 
              Lyell&#8217;s speculations on the immense age of Earth that provided 
              the essential <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual framework for Darwin&#8217;s new theory. 
              Lyell&#8217;s vastly expanded stretch of geological time provided 
              an ample temporal arena in which the forces of natural selection 
              could sculpt and reshape the species of Earth and achieve nearly 
              limitless variation.</p>
<p> The central point is that collateral advances in sciences seemingly 
              far removed from cosmology can help dissipate the intellectual limitations 
              imposed by <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and na&#239;ve human <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>. And, in 
              an uncanny reprise of the Lyell/Darwin intellectual <a class="thought" href="entries/synergy_entry.html">synergy</a>, it 
              is a realization of the vastness of time and history that gives 
              rise to the crucial insight. Only in this instance, the vastness 
              of which I speak is the vastness of future time and future history. 
              In particular, sharp attention must be paid to the key conclusion 
              of Princeton physicist John Wheeler: most of the time available 
              for life and intelligence to achieve their ultimate capabilities 
              lie in the distant cosmic future, not in the cosmic past. As cosmologist 
              Frank Tipler bluntly stated, &#8220;Almost all of space and time 
              lies in the future. By focusing attention only on the past and present, 
              science has ignored almost all of reality. Since the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of scientific 
              study is the whole of reality, it is about time science decided 
              to study the future evolution of the universe.&#8221;</p>
<p> That is exactly what I have attempted to do in <i>BIOCOSM</i> 
              in order to explore, in a tentative way, a possible third pathway 
              to an answer to the biggest of the Big Questions. I call that third 
              pathway the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis.</p>
<p> Originally presented in peer-reviewed scientific papers published 
              in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">Complexity</a></i>, <i>Acta Astronautica</i>, and the <i>Journal 
              of the British Interplanetary <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a></i>, my Selfish Biocosm hypothesis 
              suggests that in attempting to explain the linkage between life, 
              intelligence and the anthropic qualities of the cosmos, most mainstream 
              scientists have, in essence, been peering through the wrong end 
              of the telescope. The hypothesis asserts that life and intelligence 
              are, in fact, the primary cosmological phenomena and that everything 
              else&#8212;the constants of nature, the dimensionality of the universe, 
              the origin of carbon and other elements in the hearts of giant supernovas, 
              the pathway traced by biological evolution&#8212;is secondary and 
              derivative. In the words of Martin Rees, my approach is based on 
              the proposition that &#8220;what we call the fundamental constants&#8212;the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s that matter to physicists&#8212;may be <i>secondary consequences</i> 
              of the final theory, rather than direct manifestations of its deepest 
              and most fundamental level.&#8221;</p>
<p> I began developing the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis as an attempt 
              to supply two essential elements missing from a novel model of cosmological 
              evolution put forward by astrophysicist <a class="thought" href="entries/smolin_entry.html">Lee Smolin</a>. Smolin had come 
              up with the intriguing suggestion that black holes are <a class="thought" href="entries/gateway_entry.html">gateway</a>s 
              to new &#8220;baby universes&#8221; and that a kind of Darwinian population 
              dynamic rewards those universes most adept at producing black holes 
              with the greatest number of progeny. Proliferating populations of 
              baby universes emerging from the loins (metaphorically speaking) 
              of black hole-rich &#8220;mother universes&#8221; thus come to dominate 
              the total population of the &#8220;multiverse&#8221;&#8212;a theoretical 
              ensemble of all mother and baby universes. Black hole-prone universes 
              also happen to coincidentally exhibit anthropic qualities, according 
              to Smolin, thus accounting for the bio-friendly nature of the &#8220;average&#8221; 
              cosmos in the ensemble, more or less as an incidental side-effect.</p>
<p> This was a thrilling conjecture because for the first time it 
              posited a cosmic evolutionary process endowed with what economists 
              call a <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> function (i.e., a value that was maximized by the 
              hypothesized evolutionary process, which in the case of Smolin&#8217;s 
              conjecture was black hole maximization).</p>
<p> However, Smolin&#8217;s approach was seriously flawed. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> John von Neumann demonstrated in a famous 1948 Caltech lecture 
              entitled &#8220;On the General and Logical Theory of Automata,&#8221; 
              any self-reproducing <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, bacterium, human or baby universe) 
              must, as a matter of inexorable <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>, possess four essential elements:</p>
<p>1. A <i>blueprint</i>, providing the plan for construction of offspring;</p>
<p>2. A <i>factory</i>, to carry out the construction;</p>
<p>3. A <i>controller</i>, to ensure that the factory follows the 
              plan; and</p>
<p>4. A <i>duplicating machine</i>, to transmit a copy of the blueprint 
              to the offspring.</p>
<p> In the case of Smolin&#8217;s hypothesis, one could logically equate 
              the collection of physical laws and constants that prevail in our 
              universe with a von Neumann blueprint and the universe at large 
              with a kind of enormous von Neumann factory. But what could possibly 
              serve as a von Neumann controller or a von Neumann duplicating machine? 
              My goal was to rescue Smolin&#8217;s basic innovation&#8212;a cosmic 
              evolutionary model that incorporated a discernible utility function&#8212;by 
              proposing scientifically plausible candidates for the two missing 
              von Neumann elements.</p>
<p> The hypothesis I developed was based on a set of conjectures put 
              forward by Martin Rees, John Wheeler, Freeman Dyson, John Barrow, 
              Frank Tipler, and <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>. Their <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic visions suggested 
              collectively that the ongoing process of biological and technological 
              evolution was sufficiently robust, powerful, and open-ended that, 
              in the very distant future, a cosmologically extended biosphere 
              could conceivably exert a global influence on the physical state 
              of the entire cosmos. Think of this idea as the Gaia principle extended 
              universe-wide.</p>
<p> A <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of these insights lead me directly to the central 
              claim of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis: that the ongoing process 
              of biological and technological emergence, governed by still largely 
              unknown laws of complexity, could function as a von Neumann controller 
              and that a cosmologically extended biosphere could serve as a von 
              Neumann duplicating machine in a conjectured process of cosmological 
              replication.</p>
<p> I went on to speculate that the means by which the hypothesized 
              cosmological replication process could occur was through the fabrication 
              of baby universes by highly evolved intelligent life forms. These 
              hypothesized baby universes would themselves be endowed with a cosmic 
              code&#8212;an ensemble of physical laws and constants&#8212;that would 
              be life-friendly so as to enable life and ever more competent intelligence 
              to emerge and eventually to repeat the cosmic reproduction cycle. 
              Under this scenario, the physical laws and constants serve a cosmic 
              function precisely <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to that of DNA in earthly creatures: 
              they furnish a recipe for the birth and evolution of intelligent 
              life and a blueprint, which provides the plan for construction of 
              offspring.</p>
<p> I should add that if the fabrication of baby universes, which 
              is the key step in the hypothesized cosmic reproductive cycle that 
              I just outlined, sounds to you like outrageous <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>&#8212;an 
              &#8220;X-file too far,&#8221; in the words of one of my critics&#8212;you 
              should be aware that the topic has begun to be rigorously explored 
              by such eminent physicists as Andrei Linde of Stanford, Alan Guth 
              of MIT (who is the father of inflation theory), Martin Rees of Cambridge, 
              eminent astronomer Edward Harrison, and physicists Lawrence Krauss 
              and Glenn Starkman.</p>
<p> This central claim of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis offered a 
              radically new and quite parsimonious explanation for the apparent 
              mystery of an anthropic or bio-friendly universe. If highly evolved 
              intelligent life is the von Neumann duplicating machine that the 
              cosmos employs to reproduce itself&#8212;if intelligent life is, 
              in effect, the reproductive organ of the universe&#8212;then it is 
              entirely logical and predictable that the laws and constants of 
              nature should be rigged in favor of the emergence of life and the 
              evolution of ever more capable intelligence. Indeed, the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> 
              of such propensity is a falsifiable prediction of the hypothesis.</p>
<p> Now, at this point you are probably saying to yourself, &#8220;Wow, 
              with a theory that crazy and radical, this Gardner fellow must have 
              been shunned by the scientific establishment.&#8221; And indeed some 
              mainstream scientists have commented that the ideas advanced in 
              my book <i>BIOCOSM</i> are impermissibly speculative or impossible 
              to verify. A few have hurled what scientists view as the ultimate 
              epithet&#8212;that my theory constitutes metaphysics instead of genuine 
              science.</p>
<p> On the other hand, some of the brightest and most far-sighted 
              scientists have been extremely encouraging. John Barrow and Freeman 
              Dyson have offered favorable comments and reviews. In particular, 
              <i>BIOCOSM</i> has received outspoken endorsements from Sir Martin 
              Rees (the UK Astronomer Royal and winner of the top scientific prize 
              in the world for cosmology) and Paul Davies (the prominent astrophysicist 
              and author and winner of the Templeton Prize).</p>
<p> As I continue to explore this hypothesis in the future, what will 
              be of utmost interest to me and my sympathizers is whether it can 
              generate what scientists call falsifiable implications. Falsifiabiliy 
              or testability of claims, remember, is the hallmark of genuine science, 
              distinguishing it from metaphysics and faith-based belief <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p> I believe that the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis does qualify as 
              a genuine scientific conjecture on this ground. A key implication 
              of the hypothesis is that the process of progression of the cosmos 
              through critical thresholds in its life cycle, while perhaps not 
              strictly inevitable, is relatively robust. One such critical threshold 
              is the emergence of human-level and higher intelligence, which is 
              essential to the scaling up of biological and technological processes 
              to the stage at which those processes could conceivably exert an 
              influence on the global state of the cosmos.</p>
<p> The conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> among evolutionary theorists, typified 
              by the thinking of the late Stephen Jay Gould, is that the abstract 
              probability of the emergence of anything like human intelligence 
              through the natural process of biological evolution was vanishingly 
              small. According to this viewpoint, the emergence of human-level 
              intelligence was a staggeringly improbable contingent <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. A few 
              distinguished contrarians like Simon Conway Morris, <a class="thought" href="entries/wright_entry.html">Robert Wright</a>, 
              E. O. Wilson, and Christian de Duve take an opposing position, arguing 
              on the basis of the pervasive phenomenon of convergent evolution 
              and other evidence that the appearance of human-level intelligence 
              was highly probable, if not virtually inevitable. The latter position 
              is consistent with the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis while the Gould 
              position is not.</p>
<p> In my book <i>BIOCOSM</i> and in a preceding scientific paper 
              delivered at the International Astronautical Congress, I suggest 
              that the issue of the robustness of the emergence of human-level 
              and higher intelligence is potentially subject to experimental resolution 
              by means of at least three realistic tests: <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, artificial 
              life evolution, and the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a> computer intelligence 
              predicted by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> theorist Ray Kurzweil and others. 
              The discovery of <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> intelligence, the discovery of 
              an ability on the part of <a class="thought" href="entries/artificial_life_entry.html">artificial life</a> forms that exist and evolve 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> environments to acquire <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> and intelligence, and 
              the emergence of a capacity on the part of advanced self-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              computers to attain and then exceed human levels of intelligence 
              are all falsifiable implications of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis 
              because they are consistent with the notion that the emergence of 
              ever more competent intelligence is a robust natural phenomenon. 
              These tests don&#8217;t, of course, conclusively answer the question 
              of whether the hypothesis correctly describes ultimate reality. 
              But such a level of certainty is not demanded of any scientific 
              hypothesis in order to qualify it as genuine science.</p>
<p> Let me conclude by asking whether the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis 
              promotes or demotes the cosmic role of humanity. Have I introduced 
              a new anthropocentrism into the science of cosmology? If so, then 
              you should be suspect on this basis alone of my new approach because, 
              as Sigmund Freud pointed out long ago, new scientific paradigms 
              must meet two distinct criteria to be taken seriously: they must 
              reformulate our vision of physical reality in a novel and plausible 
              way and, equally important, they must advance the Copernican project 
              of demoting human beings from the centerpiece of the universe to 
              the results of natural processes.</p>
<p> At first blush, the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis may appear to be 
              hopelessly anthropocentric. Freeman Dyson once famously proclaimed 
              that the seemingly miraculous coincidences exhibited by the physical 
              laws and constants of inanimate nature&#8212;factors that render 
              the universe so strangely life-friendly&#8212;indicated to him that 
              &#8220;the more I examine the universe and study the details of its 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>, the more evidence I find that the universe in some 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> knew we were coming.&#8221; This strong anthropic perspective 
              may seem uplifting and inspiring at first blush but a careful assessment 
              of the new vision of a bio-friendly universe revealed by the Selfish 
              Biocosm hypothesis yields a far more sobering conclusion.</p>
<p> To regard the pageant of life&#8217;s origin and evolution on Earth 
              as a minor <a class="thought" href="entries/subroutine_entry.html">subroutine</a> in an inconceivably vast ontogenetic process 
              through which the universe prepares itself for replication is scarcely 
              to place humankind at the epicenter of creation. Far from offering 
              an anthropocentric view of the cosmos, the new perspective relegates 
              humanity and its probable progeny species (biological or mechanical) 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/functional_equivalence_entry.html">functional equivalent</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a>&#8212;formerly free-living 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> whose special talents were harnessed in the distant past 
              when they were ingested and then pressed into service as organelles 
              inside eukaryotic cells.</p>
<p> The essence of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis is that the universe 
              we inhabit is in the process of becoming pervaded with increasingly 
              intelligent life&#8212;but not necessarily human or even human-successor 
              life. Under the theory, the emergence of life and increasingly competent 
              intelligence are not meaningless accidents in a hostile, largely 
              lifeless cosmos but at the very heart of the vast machinery of creation, 
              cosmological evolution, and cosmic replication. However, the theory 
              does not require or even suggest that the life and intelligence 
              that emerge be human or human-successor in nature.</p>
<p> The hypothesis simply asserts that the peculiarly life-friendly 
              laws and constants that prevail in our universe serve a function 
              precisely equivalent to that of DNA in living creatures on Earth, 
              providing a recipe for development and a blueprint for the construction 
              of offspring.</p>
<p> Finally, the hypothesis implies that the capacity for the universe 
              to generate life and to evolve ever more capable intelligence is 
              encoded as a hidden subtext to the basic laws and constants of nature, 
              stitched like the finest embroidery into the very fabric of our 
              universe. A corollary&#8212;and a key falsifiable implication of 
              the Selfish Biocosm theory&#8212;is that we are likely not alone 
              in the universe but are probably part of a vast, yet undiscovered 
              transterrestrial community of lives and intelligences spread across 
              billions of galaxies and countless parsecs. Under the theory, we 
              share a possible common <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> with that hypothesized community&#8212;to 
              help shape the future of the universe and transform it from a collection 
              of lifeless atoms into a vast, transcendent mind.</p>
<p> The inescapable implication of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis 
              is that the immense saga of biological evolution on Earth is one 
              tiny chapter in an ageless tale of the struggle of the creative 
              force of life against the disintegrative acid of <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, of emergent 
              order against encroaching chaos, and ultimately of the heroic power 
              of mind against the brute intransigence of lifeless matter.</p>
<p> In taking full measure of the seeming miracle of a bio-friendly 
              universe we should obviously be skeptical of wishful thinking and 
              &#8220;just-so&#8221; stories. But we should not be so dismissive 
              of new approaches that we fail to relish the sense of wonder at 
              the almost miraculous ability of science to fathom mysteries that 
              once seemed impenetrable&#8212;a sense perfectly captured by the 
              great British innovator Michael Faraday when he summarily dismissed 
              skepticism about his almost magical ability to summon up the genie 
              of electricity simply by moving a magnet in a coil of wire.</p>
<p> As Faraday said, &#8220;Nothing is too wonderful to be true if 
              it be consistent with the laws of nature.&#8221;</p>

<br>
<br>
who? we have the eternal enigma here, we see the effect, but the cause must be hidden because nobody can observe it. indeed our 'heads may explode' while making this searching. anyway, the evolutionary tools of science may reveal in short some clues on this issue. it is like if we pretend to look for bacteria without a microscope. so we need more tools yet to see more evidences in the cosmos spectrum. and nothing is resolved yet '.

<br>
'(2) there is a second problem: why aren't we smarter faster?'
<br>
<br>
the entropy involving our local world would be intended to increase the emotional/intelligence complexity of the system to reach deeper stages of computational intelligence, due to some specific reasons which are now beyond our comprehension.
<br>
<br>
'i have some possible answers to (1), that there are real things that do not exist ("possibilities" for example) and so "nothingness" is itself an unstable state. number (2) is harder. perhaps it has to do with the nature of what you can encode in a spawned universe.'
<br>
<br>
well, in principle from nothingness it is very strange that something could emerge. again the missing 'cause'.
<br>
we could  imagine for example this scenario, that of course does not explain the cause, but serves as mere speculation with the intention to find some slight clue (probably none clue is found) :
<br>
<br>
the 'possibilities' you are referring to, could be a quasi primary cause called 'omniversal computation unit' which generated a first instruction to construct the substratum of all existance.

the omniversal computation unit is a quantum abyss (i remember that this is a pure speculation, because this is unknown at this time).
<br>
<br>
all finite domains are hosted in the abyss. the abyss is a non-fluid-beyond-space/time dimension which  lend the functionality that all local worlds can or not be connected.
<br>
<br>
both the interaction of local worlds via 'black holes' and the evolutionary patterns of every finite domain do print a kind of dynamic/continuum trace or mark in the abyss.
<br>
<br>
here the abyss could be interpreted as an indicator of the cosmological events and the evolutionary patterns derived from such events, as well. the mentioned 'trace or mark' is a quanta dynamic formula encoded in a non-physical 'logical function' or omniversal computing/non physical unit.
<br>
<br>
the local worlds function in spinning-expansion and contraction cycles, and the time flow of the several? worlds are not running in the same direction, thus the abyss does not contemplate any specific space-time direction, but all conceivable continuum combinations. thus our local universe is tunned with us in a forward direction time flow. but the black-holes are the only way out to reverse the swivels of the space/time and the unique possibility to interact with the outer worlds. also the black-holes may give the possibility for an advanced intelligent civilization to observe its own position hosted in the abyss = being able to experience the ubiquity phenomenum.

scientists detect indentation in spacetime from a spinning black hole 
<br>
mit scientists and their colleagues have found a black hole that has chiseled a remarkably stable indentation in the fabric of space and time, like a dimple in one's favorite spot on a sofa. 
<br>
the finding may help scientists measure a black hole's mass and how it spins, two long-sought measurements, by virtue of the extent of this indentation. using nasa's rossi x-ray timing explorer, the team saw identical patterns in the x-ray light emitted near the black hole over a nine-year period, as captured in archived data from 1996 and in a new, unprecedented 550-hour observation from 2005.

ucla astronomers can determine, for the first time, orbits of massive young stars located a few light months from the enormous black hole at the center of our milky way galaxy ' stars that hold an imprint of how they were born. the origin of young stars at the center of our galaxy has puzzled astronomers, but the orbits may be the key to unlocking the mystery, ucla astronomy graduate student jessica lu reported today at the annual meeting of the american astronomical society in washington, d.c. the astronomers use a new laser virtual star at the w.m. keck observatory in hawaii.''

<br>
<br>
The book we are referring to is best thought of as an extension of Lee Smolin's 'Life of The Cosmos'. Smolin's work shows how Universes whose laws of physics do not favour black hole production are 'unfit' and thus do not pass on their 'genes'. The 'genes' (the laws of physics- Smolin assumes they are mutable) that code for efficient black hole production also happen to make the universe suitable for the emergence of Carbon-based life-forms.
<br>
<br>
You could then throw in Simon Conway Morris's argument that biological evolution follows rules of constraint and convergence that inevitably ends up with a humanoid form of life, Kurzweil's argument that humanoid life kickstarts technological evolution that evolves computers until they are running at the maximum capacity allowed by the laws of physics and, finally, the argument that one could manufacture a black hole computer, which would be the most powerful computer possible.
<br>
<br>
So, Gardner's 'techno-universe' evolution only became possible after X amount of Smolin natural selected universes had refined the laws of physics through cummulative selection.
<br>
<br>
But the whole premise still falls down. Because black holes don't really exist. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think Gardner is suggesting that intelligent life takes the roll of the control function for the 'DNA' of the universe, it's physical laws ' sort of like a regulatory gene that universes have evolved  and perhaps he's suggesting that intelligent life is something like the germ line too.   
<br>
<br>
This is all a way of just pushing the problem back:  Then why is the meta-verse of such form that it can support this process of evolving universes?  I'm surprised he doesn't throw in ideas from Stuart Kauffman's modification of evolution ' that it sits on top of a self-organizing system in the first place.  For Stuart, life started as an autocatalytic set of chemicals, almost any rich enough set of chemicals will do.  Only later did life acquire a control system that allowed more orderly evolution.  Summary of Kauffman's ideas is at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100626010337/http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho32.htm" target="_blank">http://home.wxs.nl/~gkorthof/kortho32.htm</a>
<br>
<br>
If such an autocatalytic set functions also for the physical laws that make up Universes, then each one would appear mysteriously balanced.  Later they acquire the control system that allows systematic evolution. In this sense, Von Neumann was wrong.  You don't need a control system to evolve, but it has selective advantages to get a control system. 
<br>
<br>
We still bump into the question of where we are in the whole process.  If things have been going on virtually 'forever' (which one would assume from the mediocrity principle) then why is the process still so seemingly inefficient??  13B years is a long time to let your program run.  That to me is a harder question.
<br>
<br>
As an aside, I don't know why you assert black holes don't exist since the observational evidence seems to be growing in their favor. If we end up with strong observational evidence of black holes but also a theory that says they can't exist, I'd suggest it is the theory not the black holes which must cease to exist.  But either way.  What would kill the Gardner's premise would be for there to be no way to spawn another cosmos.  That is, if we are indeed living in the one and only 'Universe' rather than in a multi-verse.  Black holes might not exist and yet a multi-verse still might exist by other means.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The reason why I assert that black holes do not exist is twofold:
<br>
<br>
1: The nuclear fusion model of stars is WRONG. The correct model of electric stars does not seem to allow for the kinds of gravitational collapse associated with black holes:
<br>
<br>
'(In a star) the nucleus of each atom, which is thousands of times heavier than the electrons, will be gravitationally offset from the centre of the atom. The result is that each atom becomes a small electric dipole. These dipoles align to form a radial electric field that causes electrons to diffuse outwards to enormously greater numbers than simple gravitational sorting allows. That electric repulsion balances the compressive force of gravity without the need for a central heat source in the star. An electric star will be roughly the same density throughout, or isodense'.
<br>
<br>
If you check out www.electric-cosmos.org/hrdiagr.htm, you will see how the electric star model can easily explain stars that have been observed that are IMPOSSIBLE according to the nuclear fusion model. Black holes, then, are nothing more than mathematical constructs created by pursuing a false assumption.
<br>
<br>
2: When they say we have observed a black hole, we have in fact done nothing of the sort. All we have detected is a burst of X-Rays. The assumption is that ONLY a black hole is capable of producing these Xrays, yet plasma physics has shown how dense plasma focus is capable of producing high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray radiation and simple plasma scaling laws show why it is that the source of such prodigious outpouring of energy from an active galactic centre is so small.
<br>
<br>
So basically cosmologists using the wrong model are misinterpreting the data provided by their instruments. Black holes do not exist.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
We are encouraged to think that the universe is "Life-friendly" for reasons that seem to consist mainly of "we're here"; we certainly aren't seeing much in the way of hard evidence that there's life anywhere else.  Personally, I believe that Life is everywhere, in the grander sense, and that we haven't seen it solely because of our inability to go anywhere but that's a faith matter, no different from those who think that our presence somehow enobles the universe.
<br>
<br>
Here's an alternate point of view: perhaps we're here because we're here and if the cosmic constants were just slightly different some other form of life would be here...probably speculating on how unlikely something like us would be.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps Life has always existed, in forms we can't recognize or imagine; perhaps whole civilizations have risen and fallen in a blink of our eyes; to exclude any possibility in the face of infinite space and time seems the grandest hubris.
<br>
<br>
It would be handy if we could call up God and say: "What the heck were you thinking of?"  Failing that-and I think we can exclude that possibility-perhaps our best idea is simply to try and explore, in the hope that we might find out something useful.

It seems unlikely that this tool we use to understand; The mind, could ever be so enhanced

as to grasp infinity.
<br>
<br>
Life and all the questions posed by inquiring minds, can be understood.
<br>
<br>
Socrates injunction, "Know Thyself" is a clue.
<br>
<br>
This insight produces a way of knowing that
<br>
does not depend entirely on calculations
<br>
or mental gymnastics.
<br>
<br>
Disabuse yourself of the notion that what we
<br>
call science is the only valid way of knowing.
<br>
<br>
Understanding and appreciating that this stage

benevolence not comprehendable by a finite mind,

For the purpose of enjoying...
<br>
<br>
Existance in a human form.
<br>
<br>
To make any sense of this one must know the

mind of God, which is possible by focusing within
<br>
and understanding Life itself.
<br>
<br>
Becoming one with the creator we then see...

DNA is the script of a play we have written.

Disguising ourself as ignorant fragments of the

Is the Play

At the point where we can be both audience and

As delightful as science may be, the why of things is best answered by knowing the Self.

I'd describe myself as agnostic, but inclined towards 'anything is possible'.

I find myself leaning towards the idea that things have meaning, b/c when I trust what I am feeling, then it feels like I am in harmony with the world around me.  
<br>
<br>
Thus, 'knowing thyself' leads to accepting the apparent contradictions of life and learning to ride the waves as both actor and audience.  (Is this perhaps a Zen point of view? I am not really familiar with that philosophy.  Not that labeling it is particularly important.)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I imagine that everyone who thinks at all sooner or later thinks of themselves in relation to the universe and of the universe in relation to themselves.
<br>
<br>
Someone looks at themselves and says: I exist.  They look around and label everything they see as the Universe...and that's where I would suggest the trouble begins: the obsession with labels, as though putting a name to a thing means that we actually know the thing.  "The beginning of knowledge is calling a thing by its true name"...the beginning, not the end, the completion, the whole.
<br>
<br>
The Universe as we seem to know it is vast and old beyond our ability to comprehend.  As time progresses we doubtless will deepen what understanding we have but to assert that we will ever truly know something so grand looks like vain ambition at best and unbelievable arrogance at worst, for if we truly understood the universe, what would we be but God?
<br>
<br>
This would seem to be the chief problem with introducing unnecessary elements into a consideration of reality. Maybe there's a God, maybe there isn't, but thinking that the Universe is here because it's here requires a lot less in the way of mental gymnastics.
<br>
<br>
I certainly don't dispute anyone's right to view reality in a fashion that they feel comfortable with but I'm similarly free to question whether mystifying things will lead to any greater clarity. "DNA is the script of a play we have written."...indeed, if you can prove that one explaining the Universe in toto should be pretty easy.
<br>
<br>
Looking for God may be satisfying on a number of levels but such activity hasn't much advanced our understanding of objective reality...quite the opposite, in fact.  On the other hand, trying to understand objective reality is why we've advanced to whatever degree we have; to me that presents a clear choice.
<br>
<br>
I've often wondered where we might be if we hadn't spent so much time on an endless parade of "gods".
<br>
Well, to each his own.

<br>
<br>
Conceptual thinking (and an opposable thumb) is/are our advantage to survive in the world.  After all we really did go to the Moon.  But, it (conceptual thinking) is noise to the realization of the spiritual source that transcends the world.  How do I know that?  When you KNOW it is the seeker you seek YOU've found it.  Jim stated it clearly, Know thyself.  Dogen Zenji said, 'To study Buddhism is to study the self, to study the self is to forget the self, to forget the self is to become one with all things.'.  Witness without judgment is how to establish nondual awareness.  The faculty of awareness is itself the source.   But, you still need a knife to slice the tomato.
<br>
<br>
Technology is what we need to know about the world to survive long enough as individuals and as a culture to become Human Beings.  We don't even know what a healthy diet is yet.  Much less how to share the prosperity across the spectrum of the bell curve of talant and strength of the oneness that we are.  Too many of the smart and the strong believe they have a license to steal.  The Masons have sold out.  Honest government is an oxymoron on par with military intelligence.  Where's the hope??  That we take charge of our evolution and become Human Beings.  And that we love the Homo Sapians who haven't seen the light yet.  Love is the way, not the goal.  Let's start  a race to become Human Beings!!  And Falgiano, you made a lot of sense to me.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I like to think of things in terms of systems and generalities.  If we think back to Schrodinger's cat experiment, we look at the existence of duality.  The cat is either dead or alive. In fact though, the cat could be in any state in between as well at any one point in time.  The cat may still be alive but already poisoned and sick, or the cat may be taking it's last breath as we lift the lid to the box.  In that sense, there is not just a duality existance, but rather an infinite number of realities within the definite realms of the cat being totally dead or completely healthy and alive.
<br>
<br>
 If we parallel what was said about the number of possible string vibrations, it would seem that although we are literally inside the box, we would be in a box of immense proportions indeed.  If each mode of string vibration has an infinite number of realities due to the properties of duality, it would be inevitable that life would indeed form at some point in every single mode of string vibration that would allow life to form. 
<br>
<br>
  Fortunately we happen to exist in one of those realities which would allow life to exist.  I would bet my bottom dollar that there are other realities co-existing which also spurn life, although not necessarily as we know it. 
<br>
<br>
  If one looks within our own universe, at ourselves in particular, we push our own evolution to the limits, soon to merge with our own technology to become more than the sum of our parts.  When this happens, our evolution will push ahead even faster, almost immeasurably to our current knowledge.  In other existances, it is quite possible that the property of time has a direct effect on the evolution of life.  The faster time pushes, the faster life evolves.  The slower it lags, the longer it takes.  
<br>
<br>
  What I suppose I'm trying to say is that I think life is much more adept to the universe than the universe is to life.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It is a fine theory, however, philosophically it doesn't seem all that novel to me. It is the same play, only this time with a couple different interesting actors. The philosophical end result of the selfish biocosm is the same as all other meta-theories of the universe. It is interesting that Fred Hoyle is mentioned in this article, because his elegant theory of constant creation ends up at the same philosophical conclusion that as the selfish biocosm, and it is stated clearly in this quote from above:
<br>
<br>
"The inescapable implication of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis is that the immense saga of biological evolution on Earth is one tiny chapter in an ageless tale...."
<br>
<br>
The inescapable conclusion of all meta-theories of the universe is that it is "ageless". It has no beginning and has no end. Big Bang theorists have grappled with the question of what came before the big bang ever since the theory was first proposed. The answer is...something. Something came before, and something will come after. The selfish biocosm proposes that something intelligent came before and now has given birth to more intelligence/life, and we will repeat that process, ad infinitum.

But I think they don't really answer the *ultimately* biggest questions about the origins of the universe and the human beings. Who designs

the so-called von Neumann elements of the universe??? Why there are good and bad in the

universe &amp; living beings? Why the universe and the living beings can't be perfect at the very beginning and no need for the so-called evolution? 
<br>
Maybe the universe (including human beings) is the Creator itself.
<br>
All the so-called evolution is just for fun.
<br>
Then the good and the bad in the universe (or in the human beings) are just part of the Creator.
<br>
One funny thing I am thinking about is that human beings (or living beings) should not 
<br>
fight for the survival (or anything) because there are infinite resources in the (infinite) 
<br>
universe. In one sentence, all beings should get what they need and have the free lunches.
<br>
(Well, then some people might ask what they should do, if not necessary to work or fight.)
<br>
It just doesn't make sense that the beings are created or evolved to fight for the survival.
<br>
Human beings should be born to know everything and get everything (including highest-level self-fulfillment) they need freely.
<br>
It doesn't make sense that we need to gradually improve our world/universe through technology development.

No, but it does make sense that we would need to *progressively* improve technology in order to keep up with time, per the second law of thermodynamics in an expanding universe.  Supporting macroscopic evidence for this is apparent with our leap from apes to humans, where intelligence enabled us to harness fire, and to progressively tap into more difficult energy sources that we would otherwise not been able to touch.
<br>
<br>
That's a valid, evidenced, "natural" design hypothesis.

There are a growing number of scientists that are becoming aware of this, like Scott Sampson, museum curator, assoc. prof. of geology &amp;geophysics at the Utah Museum of Natural History.

...and I personally have independently derived this theory from physics which notes that...
<br>
<br>
No desinger is necessary if information is never lost.
<br>

The theory very simply explains causality, as well... among other things...</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi Walter,
<br>
<br>
Your thread resonates with some of my own considerations of the importance of this topic.  This is what came to me after I read your piece.
<br>
<br>
What is intelligence?  That life should spontaneously arise from matter suggests that matter itself is intelligent (Gibb's free energy is a design feature).  However it happened, here we are.  Biologically driven behavior is clearly evident in the seperated twin studies (University of Minnesota, et al).  Technology is essential to live long enough to transend biological drives as individuals (Homo Sapians) and manifest a culture of adults (Human Beings) sharing this precious gift of life.  Consider the next astroid, global warming, the next ice age or a world war with the Moslems.  Clearly, we need a lot more time to become the Human Beings we aspire to be.
<br>
<br>
Read The Field, by Lynne McTaggart.  We are One with the universe so it's not a surprise that it's 'life friendly'.  You don't need black holes as an agent for evolution.  The Zero Point Field is Here Now.  The history of the world is; Plutocracy dominates Homo Sapian affairs.  The evolution of Homo Sapian into Human Being is the current crisis and each us makes our contribution.  What is your dream and how will you make it come true?  Is it gratification of the bioself or service to Self (the Oneness that we are)?  The question is:  Are you the driver or the driven?

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi. Conrad,
<br>
<br>
I agree that there is something common between all non-living and living beings.
<br>
Maybe it''s called intelligence or consciousness or whatever.
<br>
I think there are some common connections between *all* microscopic and macroscopic objects/beings in the whole world/universe.
<br>
Such common connections should enable us to find some way to change the whole world/universe just by pressing one button (of course, this is not the button to launch the nuclear weapons or WMDs). 
<br>
For example, we can press one button and all living beings become perfect and no need to do anything (like eating/sleeping etc.).
<br>
In summary, all beings can become something like ''god'' in paradise.
<br>
It''s like a magic. I am still thinking about how to do it.
<br>
Maybe you think I am just dreaming.
<br>
As long as we don''t really know why/how human beings come to this world, we can not rule out this possibility that we can change the whole world like a magic.
<br>

<br>
I agree with your summary that 'all sentient beings are from the very beginning Buddha' (paraphrasing) and that the operative mechanism is magic (be careful what you wish for!).  That the Devine in training  requires its own realization precludes a 'button' solution to this demolition derby.  Your observation that I might think you are a dreamer remainds me of John Lennon's 'Imagine'.  The individual is sovereign and realizing the Oneness that we are is liberation.  My own view on this has been to Be Here Now and wish that every heart be opened.  Now I'll add to hit the Conscious of Conscience button.  Thanks for the inspiration!!                                        </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Hi, Conrad,
<br>
<br>
What you said is quite reasonable and maybe the probable way to improve this world/universe gradually. Unfortunately it (including technology) can''t really eliminate all misfortunes (including crimes, natural disasters, all kinds of bad things etc.) in this world/universe. Maybe people can only accept this world/universe ''as is'' and try to improve it through the so-called evolution (like technology etc.).
<br>
But I think the best way to see the origins of the universe and the human beings is like a magic (no matter with the Creator or not). The so-called evolution can''t really explain such biggest questions. Maybe this magic still exists somewhere waiting for human beings to find it and change the whole world/universe again (like re-origin).
<br>
The current world/universe is not a perfect one. Then this magic provides some parameters for human beings to adjust (that''s what I say ''pressing a button''). And the world/universe can become a perfect one after re-adjustment. 
<br>
As I said, the universe and the living beings should be perfect at the very beginning and no need for the so-called evolution.
<br>
I don''t think human beings can only follow the so-called evolution gradually.
<br>
There should be some way for human beings to change *all* microscopic (including smallest particles) and macroscopic objects/beings (including biggest galaxies and living beings) in the whole world/universe once and for all.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Here's where I have problems.
<br>
<br>
First the author sets up two objections to the Weinberg/Susskind theory that don't hold up.
<br>
<br>
The first objection is that it's untestable.  Just because something is untestable with the tools we currently have available doesn't make it untrue.  The fault lies with the tools.  So dismissing something as untrue simply because we can't test it is illogical.  
<br>
Second, the violation of the mediocrity principle is a red herring.  Of course Weinberg/Susskind violates the principle, but again it's because we lack the tools to sample beyond our own universe.
<br>
<br>
I can understand why a working scientist would devote his or her time to something that can actually be proven or falsified.  But positing a theory whose reason for existing is the inadequacy of our tools seems to me philosopically unsound.
<br>

My real objection to the Selfish Biocosm Theory, though, is that it appears to me to be another in a long series of scientific theories that boil down to "it's all about us".  One by one, each of these "all about us" theories have been debunked.  Earth was not created for the sole purpose of producing humans.  The sun does not revolve around the Earth.  If you define "us" as "life" - or rather "life as it is currrently understood by humans *in this universe* " - then the Selfish Biocosm Theory is just more of the same.  This doesn't mean it's not worth pursuing; you definitely learn something by being wrong.  It's just that I think we're once again barking up the same, wrong philosophical tree.</p></td>

<br>
No, but it is acceptable to object to using uproven theoretical speculation against the special implications of the anthropic principle, which fall from hard facts of the observed universe.  It's a different story if said speculation ever produces any testable predictions, but until then... you're stuck with the observed universe when considering implications for specialness.
<br>
<br>
I personally think that it's lame-science to *automatically* bi-pass the implications by reaching into an infinite sea of rationale in order to lose anthropic specialness, rather than to first make every effort to find out why they might be important to the physics of our observed universe.

<br>
<br>
Not so much about us, really... it isn't commonly understood that the AP is actually biocentric, not geocentric, because it readily extends to, and cannot be restricted from every last banded spiral galaxy that exists on the same evolutionary "plane" as us, with respect to the requirement that we occupy a preferred place and time in the history of the universe.
<br>
<br>
If there is some good reason why intelligent life is necessary to the physics of our universe, then it will be as "common" as the physical need requires.
<br>
<br>
Not so special... it's more arrogant to think that we can separate ourselves from the process.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I just don't get this line of thinking.  Isn't the universe, by definition, all there is?  As such, on what basis do you assign a probability value to it being the way it is?  Positing extra universes that are completely cut off causally from "our" universe seems a non-theory with no testable consequences--even in principle.
<br>
<br>
He compares his theory to Darwin's and to those who have expanded on it.  There is a big difference though.  Our planet is one of a set of all planets in the universe and, thus, you can find confirming or diconfirming evidence for the likelihood of our particular planet being the way it is and the reasons why.  For instance, if Kauffman and others are right, then as we explore the universe, we should find it teeming with life.  If not, that argues aginst his theory.  What could count as a testable consequence of the Biocosm theory?  It seems he considers a falsifiable test to be that, if it is true, life should be abundant.  This is a consequence of Kauffman's ideas, not his.
<br>
<br>
All these cosmological natural selection theories make the unstated and, in principle, unprovable assumption that our universe is one of a set of universes in an effort to explain why our universe is the way it is given it is so unlikely.  The only problem is, it only seems unlikely if you posit other universes.  This is extravagently unnecessary and circular.
<br>
<br>
The eventual suffusion of the universe with intelligence due to factors like Kauffman's autocatalytic set theory, game theoretical considerations, and Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns is an interesting hypotheis.  It's exciting and may have a great deal of explanatory power.  However, that deals with the knowable world.  The Biocosm goes beyond that into metaphysics.
<br>
<br>
As an aside, I find his constant name-dropping to be an unseemly and irrelevant distraction from an honest evaluation of his ideas.  I mean, who cares what someone who won the Templeton prize thinks?  All that means is some rich eccentric with an agenda thinks you can lend an air of respectability to his unconventional ideas.</p></td>

   I still gota hope that there are other humaniods,,who have already made the trip to and throu the singularity--They finally came to the conclution that,they wanted to See the actuall Glory of God/see his/her face--ect,ect..So they ,make the trip,,but to get there,,they have to go throu so many changes,,,and the trip itself ,,Well anyway,,,when they finally Get There,,,its really lights them up,,,Totally moves them,,and they realize SOoo much,,,,Then they turn around,,and go back ,,,in search of doing his Will,,,(doing Good),,,,happy ending...someday.

<br>
Not that I see this as necessary, but it's called, "Black hole bounce".
<br>
<br>
Scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle, by Lee Smolin:
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100626010337/http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0407213" target="_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0407213</a>
<br>
<br>
Black hole bounce results from quantum modifications on a 'classical' black hole collapse. Instead of collapsing down to a singularity, the black hole, at some point, begins to expand'producing a new region of spacetime that is not causally connected with the universe in which the black hole was originally formed. It is, in fact, a new universe.
<br>
<br>
Smolin says: 
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> A multiverse formed by black holes bouncing looks like a family tree. Each universe has an ancestor, which is another universe. Our universe has at least 1018 children, if they are like ours they have each roughly the same number of their own. </p></center>

if that's just from observation, the number is definitely up for adjustment as new "bodies" are found all the time... so, what math gathered roughly 1018 blackholes have been born or will be born?

sorry, for a lattice to continue, it must be in the right environment... that's "circumstantial"... it's common knowledge that different materials form in different environments based on pressure, gravity, temperature, etc, even if they have common elements...

Here's the deal and what I "believe" from physics that fixes Dirac's flawed Large Numbers Hypothesis, which is where Robert Dicke got his anthropic coincidence from comes from, so it necessarily completes and clarifies the anthropic principle:
<br>
<br>
There is a long pre-existing cosmological model that treats negative energy states as having negative pressure, where...
<br>
<br>
P=-u=-rho*c^2
<br>
<br>
In this model, the energy density of the vacuum is less than the matter density, so particles don't arise until vacuum energy gets condensed down over a finite enough area of space to attain positive matter density. In this case, the antigravity effect of the negative pressure vacuum mimics the effect of Dirac's negative mass states, which takes modern physics all the way back to 1917:

<br>
In Einstein's static model, G=0 when there is no matter. The cosmological constant came about because we do have matter, so in order to get rho&gt;0 out of Einstein's matter-less model, you have to condense the matter density from the existing structure, and in doing so the pressure of the vacuum necessarily becomes less than zero, P(less-than)0.
<br>
<br>
The most obvious way to create new matter in Einstein's model, (the most compatible with the spirit of general relativity), also holds it flat and stable, so any other conclusions that have been made since Einstein abandoned his notion without this knowledge, are therefore subject to suspect review, because he could have rejected arguments against his finite model based on the above. 
<br>
<br>
Tension between the vacuum and ordinary matter grows as the vacuum expands, because the increase in negative pressure that results from rarefaction of the vacuum energy, gets offset by the increase in positive gravitational curvature that results from particle creation in this model.
<br>
<br>
So tension grows until the forces that bind the finite closed spherical universe are compromised and the universe has ANOTHER Big Bang.
<br>
<br>
Causality... and the second law of thermodynamics is never violated when you make massive particles from negative pressure energy.
<br>
<br>
Boom, what happens to the need for inflationary theory if the universe has volume when a big bang occurs?
<br>
<br>
It becomes null and void.

We survive because we adapt to nature rather than nature adapting to us.  But the process of adapting means those that don't adapt die.  We're what's left of all the deaths that have gone before us.  Like the embers of a fire, we glow for our hour or two and then die out.  As it is for individuals, so will it be for societies and species and worlds.  We are, after all, made of the same stuff.  
<br>
<br>
The coding of our DNA is shared with all life forms on this planet.  The materials our DNA uses to create and perpetuate the life forms here on Earth come from the earth itself.  When we leave the Earth, we must, of necessity, take a bit of the Earth with us in the form of food, water, air and the life forms within us that allow us to process these materials.  Or else, we take a bit of the Earth and spit it out in the form of an automated space ship and a robot.  Otherwise, we would not be able to travel except on Earth.
<br>
<br>
A space ship is just a bit of the Earth we take with when we go to explore our universe.  But how can we think of changing something so large and complex as the universe when we can't even live outside the environment we've adapted to over the past few billion years?
<br>
<br>
To me it's ludicrous to think about creating new universes when we can't even manage the world we live on.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>There is no requirement that we have a conscious desire to affect the symmetry of the universe for it to be true.  Our inherent lust for energy drives us to accomplish this, so there is cosmolgical evidence that we are here for this purpose, since the *near*-"flatness" of the universe is the most apparently significant of all of the anthropic coincidences.
<br>
<br>
This identified, "significant effect" indicates that intelligent life will be as common in the universe as the need demands, and at the expense of any other forms of life that get in the way including individuals and groups of the same species, if necessary.
<br>
<br>
That's all that's necessary to make for a valid, evidenced, scientific hypothesis, either, you recognize the potential significance or you don't, and then you go from there.
<br>
<br>
You certainly won't find anything if you don't look, but it is highly probable that evolutionary theory is related to the theory of everything and the evolution of the universe if the anthropic principle is true for the above reasons, because the end result of the effect that we have is a universal scale evolutionary leap... in at least one valid cosmological model.
<br>
<br>
It is entirely logical that evolutionary theory would be related to the evolutionary process of the universe if the interpretations for anthropic specialness are true for the mentioned good physical reason for it.
<br>
<br>
In this case, the TOE becomes the ToE, because it explains why the forces can't be unified, since characteristics or traits are "convolved" inherently forward, per the second law of thermodynamics, and evolutinary theory.</p></td>

What was it that sparked the beginning of the evolution of the Biocosm?
<br>
<br>
Many human minds over-extent organic relativity, because they want to use all knowledge to satisfy themselves somehow.
<br>
<br>
I take it -- that they do not believe in more then one reality?...
<br>
<br>
Well, once things reach a certain level of absurd, I can't argue against them, it's useless.
<br>
<br>
I will simply state:
<br>
The existence of our universe proves that a universe can exist. The initiation of our universe shows that a universe can be created.
<br>
If it happens once, it can happen again. If it can happen, then it eventually will happen.
<br>
<br>
Infinite universes and realities of every possible kind exist -- but we are limited to our own dimensions, reality and universe.
<br>
<br>
There is nothing special about our reality, and there are far better realities in existence, much like everything in existence having a better, but arrogance snuck into universal theories -- and now many believe that they are the only reality, in the only universe, the superior life form, created by God, etc.
<br>
<br>
I say: Nay.
<br>
Biocosm is false.</p></td>

Um, no, that's not the way that science works.  Infinities are only necessary and permissible if a less complex theory can't resolve the same problems, or if it can't resolve the problem with as much accuracy.  
<br>
<br>
In science, if there is no theoretical need for it, then it does not exist, unless you have proof, which of course, you have NONE!

No, it's the scientific method for determining the preferred theory.
<br>
<br>
You can ramble on about what you *believe* about structure and randomness until the cows come home if you want to, but this means nothing to science if yours is not the preferred theory for some very good reason besides the fact that you think it ought to be that way.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>As interesting as the Biocosm hypothesis is, it seems to me to be riddled with flaws.  
<br>
<br>
I haven't read the book, but the essay doesn't explain why a super-advanced civilization would want to go about creating black holes to generate causally-disconnected "baby" universes, life-suitable or otherwise.  The only motive that seems obvious or inevitable to me would be colonization--creating a place where they could go to escape their own, dying universe.
<br>
<br>
If this is their motivation, then our universe would have been flooded with extra-cosmic immigrants advanced beyond our wildest imagination.  Surely the presence of such a supremely powerful and vast supercivilization could not go unnoticed.
<br>
<br>
In the absence of a "practical" motivation such as this, we're left to posit something else, like "they wanted to perpetuate Life" or "they wanted to have 'children' evolve after them."  True, a civilization could have such motives, but then again, it could not.  Since the goal of the Biocosm hypothesis is to propose some "inevitable" reason why our universe should have the physical constants it does, relying on cultural values of an alien civilization (which are, ultimately, chosen and somewhat arbitrary) does not, IMO, accomplish the goal.
<br>
<br>
Also, as I see it, the entire edifice rests on a very shaky foundation--"M-theory."  It seems to me that so much of what passes for "cosmology" and "physics" these days is not much more than experimentally untestable, and extremely arcane neo-Platonic philosophy promulgated by a Priesthood initiated into the inscrutable mathematics of their Order.  
<br>
<br>
This mathematics is in turn based on ancient Greek geometry, e.g. the "one-dimensional lines" that are looped to form the "strings" of "string theory."  As brilliant as the ancient Greeks were, there is no guarantee that their geometry represents the actual "coordinate-system" of Universe, any more than Ptolmaic astronomy represented an accurate picture of the Solar System.
<br>
<br>
To the contrary, it can be argued that ancient Greek geometry does not reflect the nature of experientially/experimentally-comprehended reality and is therefore inaccurate as a Universal coordinate-system.  See Buckminster Fuller's "Synergetics" vols. I and II for a thorough debunking of Greek geometry and a full explanation of an alternative geometrical system whose development resulted in the discovery of practical applications such as the geodesic dome and the octet truss.
<br>
<br>
As an example of the fallacy of Greek geometry, consider the "one-dimensional" loops that form the "strings" of string theory--entities that have length (in this case, circumfrence) but not height or width.  It is an observational fact that no measurement in Universe can be smaller than the Planck length. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100626010337/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length)</a>
<br>
<br>
The Uncertainty Principle of quantum mechanics rules out the possibility of defining a smaller measurement, even in principle.  The Planck length is 10^-33 cm, an extremely small though quite concrete distance.  From this, a "string" or other object having a thickness (i.e. height/width) of less than 10^33 cm cannot exist.
<br>
<br>
If this is correct, then the entire theoretical (and experimentally untested) edifice built upon these "strings"--including the seven "extra" dimensions, the "branes" of brane theory, the multiverse, etc. collapses.
<br>
<br>
It does not make sense to me to construct a cosmology based on entities that can exist only in Plato's World of Forms and call it anything other than a philosophy.
<br>
<br>
Speaking of philosophy, Gardiner states a debatable philosophical premise as fact:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> Have I introduced a new anthropocentrism into the science of cosmology? If so, then you should be suspect on this basis alone of my new approach because, as Sigmund Freud pointed out long ago, new scientific paradigms must meet two distinct criteria to be taken seriously: they must reformulate our vision of physical reality in a novel and plausible way and, equally important, they must advance the Copernican project of demoting human beings from the centerpiece of the universe to the results of natural processes. </p></center>
<br>
First: Since when is Sigmund Freud any sort of an authority to be "taken seriously" in physics?
<br>
<br>
Second: Why must a new vision of physical reality necessarily "demote" human beings to be considered valid?  This is no more valid than to state as an a priori assumption that a valid physical theory must "promote" human beings before it can be taken seriously.  I see no reason to accept either postulate as an axiom.
<br>
<br>
Third: Who says Copernicus (and by derivation, the "Copernican project") "demoted" human beings?  This is a very common assumption, but IMO it stems from a vast misunderstanding of the meaning of both the Copernican cosmology and the Ptolmaic one it replaced.
<br>
<br>
The usual spin goes something like this: "Before Copernicus, people believed that humans resided at the center of the universe, and were therefore entities of paramount importance.  Copernicus demonstrated that humans do not exist at the center of the universe, and therefore, humans are insignificant."
<br>
<br>
A quick look at one of those old woodcuts of the Ptolmaic/medieval vision of the Universe dispels the first half of that notion.  True, Earth is at the "center," but what is portrayed at the periphery?  GOD!  And if you look closely at the medieval conception of Earth, you will see that beneath the surface there are nine concentric inner spheres or "circles" going inward, just as there are the seven "heavenly" "circles" or hollow spheres radiating outward with God and his "Heaven" beyond the final boundary.
<br>
<br>
And what is in the very center of these nine inner spheres?  SATAN, enthroned in the Ninth Circle of Hell!  So, if we take this modern gloss on the pre-Copernican cosmology as true, then the Medieval Catholic Church must have believed that Man was more important than God and the Angelic realms intermediate between the Seventh Heaven and the Earth, and that Satan was more "central" still!
<br>
<br>
This is absurd on its face.  A religion that once preached "mortification of the flesh" such as self-torture, fasting and radical asceticism--and still teaches that humans are, by nature, miserable sinners rightfully deserving of eternal torture by virtue of being born *human*--can hardly be offered as a philosophy with an over-inflated sense of humanity's position in Universe.
<br>
<br>
Before Christianity, the Greeks held to a dualistic view in which the heavens operated according to different, more "perfect" laws than the Earth.  The heavenly bodies, all spherical and embedded in nested spheres (because the sphere is a "perfect" geometric shape) "had to" move in circles because circles were "perfect."
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the "perfect" heavens did not run down in terms of motion as things down here in the "imperfect" world did (e.g. if pushed, a wagon will eventually stop unless further force is applied, while the Sun and planets just keep going 'round and 'round).
<br>
<br>
Thus, the Ptolmaic/Medieval cosmology did not place man at the "center," but at the *bottom* of a Universe in which cosmic relevance increased with "height," i.e. distance from the "center."  Which is why "higher" is still synonymous with "better" and "lower" with "worse" in our language to this day.
<br>
<br>
The "Copernican" cosmology (which would not have replaced Ptolmaic cosmology without Kepler and Galileo) proposed that, rather than being at the bottom of the cosmic heap, Earth was a heavenly body like the others, and that the same "laws" applied to Earth as to the other bodies.
<br>
<br>
No longer was Earth "below" the heavens and under the heel of a cosmological tyrant.  The Biblical notion that "The heavens are My [God's] throne, and the Earth is My footstool" was empirically refuted.  At a stroke, humans became heavenly beings.
<br>
<br>
Kepler also demonstrated that the heavenly bodies did not move in "perfect" Ptolmaic cirles, but in ellipses.  The "Heavens/earth" duality was banished.  
<br>
<br>
Perhaps one could argue that for humans not to be cosmologically defined as sinners and slaves of a Big King Up There represents a "demotion," but that's a debatable proposition to say the least.
<br>
<br>
True, Earth does not appear to be a cosmological "special place."  But in the medieval cosmology, the "special place" was the "higher" realms in the Heavens, not the Earth.  By abolishing the notion of a certain "special place" in Universe the "Copernican Project" has defined our Solar System as the cosmological equal of any other.   
<br>
<br>
Thus, the notion that a valid scientific theory *must* "demote" humans is only one possible (and in my opinion, highly questionable) interpretation of the meaning of the Copernican Revolution.  Hardly an axiom!  This is not to say that a valid scientific model *must* "promote" humans either.  There is no evidence that cosmology exists to humiliate *or* exalt humans.  To suggest either is the very "anthropocentrism" scientists claim they reject.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, to derive from Copernicus' discovery that there can be *no* "special places" up to and including Universe itself (hence, there must be lots of universes in order to make "this one" ordinary) is a non-sequitor of literally astronomical proportions.
<br>
<br>
After all, Earth orbits in a narrow solar "sweet spot" that makes it "just right" for life to exist.  The sun itself is a "Goldilocks" star of the right size, duration, elemental composition, and degree of stability to make its planetary system an abode for life.  
<br>
<br>
We could just as easily derive from this that there are, in fact "special places" in Universe, and that our Earth is in one of them.  Therefore, the notion that our Universe is "special" ceases to be a problem. 
<br>
<br>
The Copernican Revolution can be interpreted to provide at least two different viewpoints:
<br>
<br>
1) There are *no* "special places" in all of existence, humans are insignificant because they're not at the Cosmic Center (there is no such place), therefore a proper scientific theory *must* define humans as insignificant.
<br>
<br>
2) Earth is a heavenly body.  There is no "higher" or "lower."  Humans are cosmological equals of all other beings in Universe (though some may be technologically more advanced, others less).  What "special places" do exist are those suitable for the formation and sustainence of Life--and we're *in* one.  Therefore, a proper scientific theory must define all Life as "special," yet equal in a cosmological sense to other Life in Universe.
<br>
<br>
Other viewpoints could, of course, exist, such as: "Evaluating the significance of humans by their physical "place in Universe" is just plain silly.  "Significance" is something only intelligent life-forms can come up with, and a given species' evaluation of its "significance" is a product of its culture and philosophy, not science or cosmology."
<br>
<br>
In other words, using "Copernican" postulates such as "there must be lots of universes so ours can be ordinary" as an a priori foundation for a cosmological world-view is philosophy or religion, not science.
<br>
<br>
Further evidence that much of modern cosmology is neo-Platonic philosophy dressed in equations can be found in some of the epicycles used to prop up the Big Bang theory.  It was originally proposed that Universe had to be "flat" (i.e. there would be just about enough matter/gravity to balance the outward expansion of the Big Bang) so that structures like galaxies and stars could form instead of spreading out too rapidly as radiation and gas or collapsing too quickly into a Big Crunch.
<br>
<br>
Then it was observed that there was nowhere near enough luminous matter to counter universal expansion.  And so, "Dark Matter" was born.  Though there are some definite examples of unseen gravitating objects (detectible when we see a luminous object orbiting an invisible body, or light being "lensed" around an unseen object), these do not provide anywhere near the needed amount of invisible matter.
<br>
<br>
It turned out that in order for the Universe to conform to the Priesthood's equations, that well over 99% of Universe had to be composed of invisible "Dark Matter."  And so, the search for "Dark Matter" began. We learned of entirely new (and undetected) kinds of matter with entertaining names like WIMPS and MACHOS. 
<br>
<br>
Even though the cosmos is supposed to be chock full of the stuff, it's all "out there" somewhere, not here in our Solar System where it can be observed.  Hence, the return of duality in physical law.  There's the matter that we can experience "down here," and there's all that Exotic Stuff Up There defined into existence by the Priesthood's holy equations.
<br>
<br>
Then it got even worse: we found out that the rate of cosmic expansion is *accelerating* rather than slowing, or so it seems.  So now we have "Dark Energy," a new cosmic epicycle to prop up the Big Bang theory.  
<br>
<br>
Then throw in the other epicycles like "Inflation" (a magic force that switched on and off at just the right times to make the gigantic cosmic super-structures unpredicted by the original Big Bang theory possible, again invoked by the arcane equations of the Adepts)  
<br>
<br>
The Big Bang seems--to me at least--an extremely rickety construct of the same sort of a priori "pure Reason" philosophizing that gave us the Ptolmaic cosmology and hindered the advancement of experimental science for 2000 years.  
<br>
<br>
It is plausible and accepted (IMO) largely because cosmologists are basing their theories on the ancient Greek geometrical coordinate system which was derived not by observing and experimenting in reality, but by a process of "pure Reason" that dealt with a Higher Realm of "Essences" and "Forms" rather than the gritty "reality" in which we mere humans lived.   
<br>
<br>
As a result, modern cosmologists are being led by their ancient progenitors down a much more elaborate and arcane version of the same blind alley that produced the dogmas of Ptolmaic cosmology and Aristotelian physics.  In short: GIGO.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I find the article very interesting and very frustrating. It seems that you've had some good ideas but seem quite reluctant or unwilling to let go of terra firma (speaking speculatively) or terra career (speaking politically). In no particular order:
<br>
<br>
1. You say:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "...The essence of the Selfish Biocosm hypothesis is that the universe we inhabit is in the process of becoming pervaded with increasingly intelligent life'but not necessarily human or even human-successor life...." </p></center>
<br>
and
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "Under the theory, we share a possible common fate with that hypothesized community'to help shape the future of the universe and transform it from a collection of lifeless atoms into a vast, transcendent mind." </p></center>
<br>
I observe in these statements a common presumption   I'll label (loosely)'duality' - that is, it appears taken for granted (by you) that the universe we are alive within is (a) not itself alive (and you can't YET prove it conclusively one way or another); and/or (b) that, somehow, if it is alive, our life (e.g. human life on planet Earth) is divorced from it. I.E. 
<br>
<br>
That if the uiverse is alive it is ANOTHER (different from us) living creature, and that we are not ourselves creatures that are a functioning, elemental part of it as a larger life form. (As you or someone else analogized, think of us as mitochondria). 
<br>
<br>
I don't argue for or against the presumption, I do argue that it has been made by you in one direction (and many modern 'scientific' others) and this presumption is central to many of your views (however unconsciously). The assumption or presumption by many, however decorated by others they are, doesn't make the presumption fact or true in reality, though it may be "true" in the 'model logic' being used to model reality. 
<br>
<br>
Some folks will argue (as several have in the comments) that a brief look outside of the 'window' and into the universe serves to demonstrate how hostile it is to "life". I think that kind of view is both arrogant and short-sighted. The "view" of much of the life that comprises our own individual selves would reach much the same conclusion if they (cells and intracellular bodies like mitochondria, for example) had the capacity to look outside of their environment (into the body general), and certainly, outside of the body itself.
<br>
<br>
They'd find a"universe" 'infinitely' larger than the environment they inhabited and implacably hostile to their independent existence (the key view being of course "independent"). Which leads me to:
<br>
<br>
2. Compared to humans who live (on average), say, 80 years (for discussion purposes), the life of a a mayfly that is born, lives, reproduces, and dies in a 24 hour period, is almost incomprehensibly short. 
<br>
<br>
One year of life for us has seen some 300 mayfly generations come and gone. In comparable terms it's as if a single individual might know a human from some 24,000 years ago - and then every single one of their direct descendants right through to today (if they were paying attention, how many of us watch mayflys so avidly?). And that would not have begun to scratch the timespan over which such a creature lived and spread its attention. 
<br>
<br>
What's my point?
<br>
<br>
Your Von Neumann controllers and duplicators (a model or idea, and hence an abstraction of a certainly more complex reality) could be far more different than your current beliefs and present imagination permit. Consider the possibility (much explored in science fiction) that the universe is not only alive in a fundamental sense (and hence inheres levels of intelligence in the very fabric of space itself as well as in energy and matter) and that, differently, yet possibly relatedly, solar masses (Stars) are alive - beings with a range of sentience.
<br>
<br>
If so, we (humans) would be rather like mayflies (in terms of comparative time frames) who come and go across the seasons of a field (planet) and occasionally (like locusts) strip it bare or kill it (for awhile). Maybe we are paid attention by such awarenesses as and when we begin to manifest 'interesting' effects. Again, I don't argue for or against this idea. I do argue that your view is very narrow in its apparent life/non-life take of the universe, and of what nature that life can be. 
<br>
<br>
The Milky Way alone, only one of 30 or so galaxies in our "local cluster", has at today's rough count, some half a trillion (with a 'T') suns. If they were a form of life, might your view and the considerations you were discussing look a little and be a little different? I think the real challenge is not the discussion itself, interesting as it is and your point of view in it, but yours and other belief systems in this matter, which leads me to:
<br>
<br>
3. You say:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "...And testability is the hallmark of genuine science, distinguishing it from fields of inquiry like metaphysics and theology..." </p></center>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "...Falsifiabiliy or testability of claims, remember, is the hallmark of genuine science, distinguishing it from metaphysics and faith-based belief systems...." </p></center>
<br>
And so they are. Or so it seems. Arthur C. Clarke said it best in his 3rd Law which states: 
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' </p></center>
<br>
<br>
We live in a world whose present technologies would have had many of us burnt at the stake, or locked in an asylum, even a mere hundred years ago (1900: The 20th century built upon the 19th, but when the 20th century began there was no air conditioning, no insulin, neon lights, atomic energy, MBAs, teabags, nylon, robots, traffic signals, cornflakes, sonar, man-made plastics, lasers or crossword puzzles. There were no cell phones, no aircraft, nor airlines, no radio, radar, microwaves, antibiotics, automobiles, medical x-rays or television, nor electron microscopes, movie theatres, canned beer, aerosol spray cans or computers. 
<br>
<br>
And in 2000, France was getting 80% of its power from an energy source that was unknown in 1900. Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Japan were getting more than 30% from this source, unknown in 1900. Remember, people in 1900 didn't know what an atom was. They didn't know its structure. 
<br>
<br>
They also didn't know what an airport was, or a rocket, a satellite, an MRI, ICU, IUD, IBM, IRA, ERA, EEG, EPA, IRS, DOD, PCP, HTML, internet. interferon, instant replay, remote sensing, remote control, speed dialing, gene therapy, gene splicing, genes, spot welding, heat-seeking, bipolar, Prozac, leotards, lap dancing, email, tape recorder, CDs, airbags, plastic explosive, cars, liposuction, transduction, superconduction, dish antennas, step aerobics, smoothies, twelve-step, ultrasound, nylon, rayon, Teflon, fiber optics, carpal tunnel, laser surgery, laparoscopy, corneal transplant, kidney transplant, AIDS' 
<br>
<br>
None of this would have meant ANYTHING to a person in the year 1900. They wouldn't know what you or I were talking about. And a lot of what we were talking about would have landed us in serious trouble, or worse.
<br>
<br>
We aren't a bit different, despite how inflated we feel about having copped a feel in the twentieth century of 'really' understanding the basic physical laws of the universe. In truth our understanding remains primitive at best. For now. 
<br>
<br>
All this is simply to say is that as much as any religious fanatic, today's scientists remain also very much blinded by their belief systems, paradigms, and professional practices - as any student, practicing scientist or academic professor (in any scientific field) with ideas different enough from 'the mainstream' can tell you. 
<br>
<br>
Career and compensation suicide (i.e. belief systems in institutional practice) are far more powerful influencers and restrainers of the best ideas these days than whether or not the idea put forward is as you put it 'falsifiable' or 'testable'...  - as anyone, for instance, who posts "radical" on the physics preprint servers can attest. 
<br>
<br>
To repeat and re-emphasize your comment here:
<br>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> "...Falsifiabiliy or testability of claims, remember, is the hallmark of genuine science, distinguishing it from metaphysics and faith-based belief systems...." </p></center>
<br>
Not at all. 
<br>
<br>
The distinction is a moving schizoid child of politics, beliefs, practices, and results. In order to put in the effort to falsify or test claims, results, etc. both your belief system and your professional practice have to permit (intentionally used) that, and if so, permit the dissemination of results (can anyone spell 'peer review' - yes it has good aspects as well as). 
<br>
<br>
Usually they (personal and professional belief systems in practice) do not permit that kind of enquiry (hence the definition of 'mainstream'), which is why scientific paradigms in the last 200 years have mostly changed when the older leaders have literally popped their clogs (died off), or are forcibly changed thru some crisis, or the revealed 'new truth' is so devastating of the old, or sufficiently so, or just so plain useful, that it cannot be ignored.
<br>
<br>
So before falsifiability or testability, it pays to ask which set of belief systems are doing the falsifying and testing, because they'll have built in, and in a definite sense, arbitrary historical constraints (compare the belief systems of Russian  vs. American physical scientists - where one fears to tread (belief-wise), the other has boldly gone 
<br>
- I'll leave you to say which is which :-)).
<br>
<br>
In summary: You're not carrying your ideas out far enough; You're still married to the "universe dead/we're alive" point of view; and to our still quaint 21st century notions of what can be. Step out a whole lot further. 
<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the real revolution in science will come when we start opening up minds, train them "open" instead of "closed", and apply our best efforts to intrinsically accelerating them. Our "best" idiot savants, scientists, and artists reveal just a little of what we're capable of.
<br>
<br>
Then, perhaps, the other lobe of the singularity will come into view: as much as our machine systems are curving towards something, so can we - cognitively and biologically - we haven't begun to scratch the surface on what WE could be if we manifest and develop our potential. And we can exponentiate as far out as any future AI can, if we develop ourselves.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The hypothetical details you provide as to how the universe enables evolution are very interesting, but the overall premise that "the universe we inhabit is in the process of becoming pervaded with increasingly intelligent life" is far from a new theory. It has been the subject of many recent books like "Decoding the Universe" by Charles Seife and "Programming the Universe" by Seth Lloyd, as well as older books like "Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life" by Daniel C. Dennett.
<br>
<br>
Your premise that "highly evolved intelligent life forms" enable a universe where presumably equally intelligent life forms could also evolve is the fundamental presumption of the Mormon religion:

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I walked away from this article with the impression that the universe (as we know it now) is just the current step in universal evolution, and the mean by which it reaches this end (universal replication) is intelligence. Right so far (I hope so)?
<br>
<br>
If this is true, then is it intelligence that creates the universe? In the prior universe did some intelligent force reach such, for lack of a better word, intelligence, and learn how to create a universe, following suite of a seemingly infinite stretch of time of universal reproduction? 
<br>
<br>
Did it do this to save or recreate a universe that was flawed? Or on the same line of thought, will our universe eventually reach a death point, by which time the prevailing intelligence of our universe will save it by creating a new universe? One designed to be better then the current one? 
<br>
<br>
This implies that the universe is increasingly becoming more stable after the work of countless remakes by prevailing intelligences. Which begs the question, what is a perfect universe?</p></td>
