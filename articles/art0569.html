<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>I vividly recall a particular car trip from my childhood because 
              it was when I invented the laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. I had seen early teletype 
              terminals; on this trip I accidentally opened a book turned on its 
              side and realized that there was room on the lower page for a small 
              typewriter keyboard, and on the upper page for a small display screen. 
              I didn't have a clue how to make such a thing, or what I would do 
              with it, but I knew that I had to have one. I had earlier invented 
              a new technique for untying shoes, by pulling on the ends of the 
              laces; I was puzzled and suspicious when my parents claimed prior 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of my idea. It would take me many more years to discover 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/kay_entry.html">Alan Kay</a> had anticipated my design for the laptop and at that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> was really inventing the portable <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> at Xerox's 
              Palo Alto <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Center (PARC).</p>
<p>Despite the current practice of putting the best laptops in the 
              hands of business executives rather than children, my early desire 
              to use a laptop is much closer to Alan's <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for creating one. 
              Alan's project was indirectly inspired by the work of the Swiss 
              psychologist <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a>, who from the 1920s onward spent years 
              and years studying children. He came to the conclusion that what 
              adults see as undirected play is actually a very <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>d activity. 
              Children work in a very real <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> as little scientists, continually 
              positing and testing theories for how the world works. Through their 
              endless interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s with the things around them, they 
              learn first how the physical world works, and then how the world 
              of ideas works. The crucial implication of Piaget's insight is that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> cannot be restricted to classroom hours, and cannot be 
              encoded in lesson plans; it is a process that is enabled by children's 
              interaction with their environment.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/papert_entry.html">Seymour Papert</a>, after working with Piaget, brought these ideas 
              to MIT in the 1960s. He realized that the <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a>s just becoming 
              available to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers might provide the ultimate sandbox for 
              children. While the rest of the world was developing <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s for accountants and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers, Seymour and his collaborators 
              created LOGO for children. This was a <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that let kids express 
              abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming constructs in simple intuitive terms, and best 
              of all it was <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>d to physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s so that <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s could 
              move things outside of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as well as inside it. The first 
              one was a <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> "turtle" that could roll around under control of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, moving a pen to make drawings.</p>
<p>Infected by the <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> of interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for children, Alan 
              Kay carried the idea to the West Coast, to Xerox's Palo Alto <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 
              Center. In the 1970s, he sought to create what he called a Dynabook, 
              a portable personal <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> navigator shaped like a notebook, 
              a fantasy amplifier. The result was most of the familiar <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s 
              of personal computing.</p>
<p>Unlike early <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s that required a specification 
              of a precise sequence of steps to be executed, modern <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>-oriented 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>s can express more complex relationships among abstract 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>-oriented <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> was Smalltalk, 
              invented by Alan to let children play as easily with <a class="thought" href="entries/symbol_entry.html">symbol</a>ic worlds 
              as they do with physical ones. He then added <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s 
              that were being developed by Doug Engelbart up the road at the Stanford 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Institute.</p>
<p>Doug was a radar <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er in World War II. He realized that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              could be more like a radar console than a typewriter, interactively 
              drawing graphics, controlled by an assortment of knobs and levers. 
              Picking up a theme that had been articulated by <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a> (the 
              person most responsible for the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>'s support of scientific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> during and after the war) in 1945 with his proposal for 
              a mechanical extender of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> called a Memex, Doug understood 
              that such a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could help people navigate through the increasingly 
              overwhelming world of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. His colleagues <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that he 
              was nuts.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s were specialized <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s used for <a class="thought" href="entries/batch_processing_entry.html">batch processing</a>, 
              not interactive personal appliances. Fortunately, Engelbart was 
              able to attract enough funding to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a laboratory around the 
              heretical notion of studying how people and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s might better 
              interact. These ideas had a coming out in a rather theatrical demo 
              he staged in San Francisco in 1968, showing what we would now recognize 
              as an interactive <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> and multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> on 
              a screen.</p>
<p>In 1974 these <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s came together in the Xerox Alto prototype, 
              and reached the market in Xerox's <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">Star</a>. The enormous influence of 
              this <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> was matched by its enormous price tag, about $50,000. 
              This was a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> that only big corporations could afford. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> and mice finally became widely available and affordable 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/apple_entry.html">Apple</a>'s Macintosh, inspired by <a class="thought" href="entries/jobs_entry.html">Steve Jobs</a>'s visit to PARC in 
              1979, and the rest of personal computing caught up in 1990 when 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> released <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> 3.0.</p>
<p>The prevailing <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> for how people use <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s hasn't really 
              changed since Englebart's show in 1968. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s have proliferated, 
              their performance has improved, but we still organize <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> and manipulate it with a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>. For years the next big 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> has been debated. There is a community that studies such 
              things, called <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> Interactions. To give you an idea 
              of the low level of that discussion, one of the most <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>ful 
              HCI <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, Bill Buxton (chief scientist at <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">Silicon</a> Graphics), 
              is known for the insight that people have two hands. A <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> forces 
              you to manipulate things with one hand alone; Bill develops <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s 
              that can use both hands.</p>
<p>A perennial contender on the short list for the next big <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> 
              is speech recognition, promising to let us talk to our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s 
              as naturally as we talk to each other. Appealing as that is, it 
              has a few serious problems. It would be tiring if we had to spend 
              the day speaking continuously to get anything done, and it would 
              be intrusive if our <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s with other people had to be punctuated 
              by our <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s with our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Most seriously, even if 
              speech recognition <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s worked perfectly (and they don't), the 
              result is no better than if the commands had been typed. So much 
              of the frustration in using a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is not the effort to enter 
              the commands, it's figuring out how to tell it to do what you want, 
              or trying to interpret just what it has done. Speech is a piece 
              of the puzzle, but it doesn't address the fundamental mysteries 
              confronting most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> users.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> has always been dreams, using <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> control to 
              direct a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. There is now serious work being done on making 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can read minds. One technique used is magnetoencephalography 
              (MEG), which places sensitive detectors of magnetic fields around 
              a head and measures the tiny neural currents flowing in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. 
              Another technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging, uses <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a> 
              to make a 3D map of chemical distributions in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to locate 
              where metabolic activity is happening. Both of these can, under 
              ideal conditions, deduce something about what is being <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, 
              such as distinguishing between listening to <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> and looking at 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>, or moving one hand versus the other. The problem that both 
              struggle with is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>'s internal representation is not 
              designed for external consumption.</p>
<p>Early <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mers did a crude form of MEG by placing a radio near 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>; the <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of static could reveal when a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> got 
              stuck in a loop. But as soon as video displays came along it became 
              much easier for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to present the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in a meaningful 
              form, showing just what it was doing. In theory the same <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              could be deduced by measuring all of the voltages on all of the 
              leads of the chips; in practice this is done only by <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> manufacturers 
              in testing new <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and it takes weeks of effort.</p>
<p>Similarly, things that are hard to measure inside a person are 
              simple to recognize on the outside. For example, hold your finger 
              up and wiggle it back and forth. You've just performed a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> control 
              task that the Air Force has spent a great deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and money 
              trying to replicate. They've built a cockpit that lets a pilot control 
              the roll angle by <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>; trained operators on a good day can 
              slowly tilt it from side to side. They're a long way from flying 
              a plane that way.</p>
<p>In fact, a great deal of the work in developing <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s 
              is actually closer to wiggling your finger. It's much easier to 
              accidentally measure <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s that come from muscle tension in 
              your forehead or scalp than it is to record signals from deep in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Instead of trying to teach people to do the equivalent 
              of wiggling their ears, it's easier to use the parts of our bodies 
              that already come <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> for us to interact with the world.</p>
<p>Another leading contender for the next big <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> is 3D graphics. 
              Our world is three-dimensional; why limit the screen to two dimensions? 
              With advances in the speed of graphical processors it is becoming 
              possible to render 3D scenes as quickly as 2D <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> are now drawn. 
              A 3D desktop could present the files in a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as the drawers 
              of a file cabinet or as a shelf of books, making browsing more intuitive. 
              If you're willing to wear special glasses, the 3D illusion can be 
              quite convincing.</p>
<p>A 3D display can even be more than an illusion. My colleague Steve 
              Benton invented the reflection <a class="thought" href="entries/hologram_entry.html">hologram</a>s on your credit cards; his 
              group is now developing real-<a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> holographic video. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              calculates the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> that would be reflected from a three-dimensional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, and modulates a <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> beam to produce exactly that. Instead 
              of tricking the eyes by using separate displays to produce an illusion 
              of depth, his display actually creates the exact <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> that 
              the synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> would reflect.</p>
<p>Steve's <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is a technological tour de force, the realization 
              of a long-standing <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> in the display community. It's also slightly 
              disappointing to many people who see it, because a holographic car 
              doesn't look as good as a real car. The problem is that <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> 
              is just too good. The eye has the equivalent of many thousands of 
              lines of resolution, and a refresh rate of milliseconds. In the 
              physical world there's no delay between moving an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> and seeing 
              a new perspective. Steve may someday be able to match those specifications 
              with holographic video, but it's a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>Instead of struggling to create a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> world that can replace 
              our physical world, there's an alternative: augment it. Embrace 
              the means of interaction that we've spent eons perfecting as a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, 
              and enhance them with <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>.</p>
<p>Consider Doug Engelbart's influential <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>. It is a two'dimensional 
              controller that can be moved left and right, forward and backward, 
              and intent is signaled by pressing it. It was preceded by a few 
              centuries by another two-dimensional controller, a violin bow. That, 
              too, is moved left and right, forward and backward, and intent is 
              communicated by pressing it. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> the bow and <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> are 
              very similar. On the other hand, while a good <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> might cost $10, 
              a good bow can cost $10,000. It takes a few moments to learn to 
              use a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, and a lifetime to learn to use a bow. Why would anyone 
              prefer the bow?</p>
<p>Because it lets them do so much more. Consider the differences 
              between the bow technique and the <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> technique:</p>
<p><i><u>Bow Technique</u></i></p>

<p>There's much more to the bow than a casual marketing list of features 
              might convey. Its exquisite physical construction lets the player 
              perform a much richer control task, relying on the intimate connection 
              between the <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> of the bow and the tactile <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> to the 
              hand manipulating and sensing its <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>. Compare that nuance to 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, which can be used perfectly well while wearing mittens.</p>
<p>When we did the cello project I didn't want to ask Yo-Yo to give 
              up this marvelous <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>; I retained the bow and instead asked 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to respond to it. Afterward, we found that the sensor 
              I developed to track the bow could respond to a hand without the 
              bow. This kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> is apparent any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> a radio makes static 
              when you walk by it, and was used back in the 1930s by the Russian 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> Lev Termen in his Theremin, the musical staple of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>-fiction 
              movies that makes eerie sounds in response to a player waving their 
              arms in front of it.</p>
<p>My student Josh Smith and I found that lurking behind this behavior 
              was a beautiful mathematical problem: given the charges measured 
              on two-dimensional electrodes, what is the three'dimensional distribution 
              of material that produced it? As we made headway with the problem 
              we found that we could make what looks like an ordinary table, but 
              that has electrodes in it that create a weak electric field that 
              can find the location of a hand above it. It's completely unobtrusive, 
              and responds to the smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a>s a person can make (millimeters) 
              as quickly as they can make them (milliseconds). Now we don't need 
              to clutter the desk with a rodent; the <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> can disappear into 
              the furniture. There's no need to look for a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> since you always 
              know where to find your hand.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> board that we developed to make these measurements 
              ended up being call a "Fish," because fish swim in 3'D instead of 
              mice crawling in 2'D, and some fish that live in murky waters use 
              electric fields to detect <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s in their vicinity just as we were 
              rediscovering how to do it. In retrospect, it's surprising that 
              it has taken so long for such an exquisite <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to get 
              used for <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s. There's been an anthropomorphic tendency 
              to assume that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s senses should match our own.</p>
<p>We had trouble keeping the Fish boards on hand because they would 
              be carried off around the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab by students who wanted to build 
              physical <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s. More recently, the students have been acquiring 
              as many radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips as they can 
              get their hands on. These are tiny processors, small enough even 
              to be swallowed, that are powered by an external field that can 
              also exchange <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> with them. They're currently used in niche applications, 
              such as tracking laboratory <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s, or in the key-chain tags that 
              enable us to pump gas without using a credit card. The students 
              use them everywhere else. They make coffee cups that can tell the 
              coffeemaker how you like your coffee, shoes that can tell a doorknob 
              who you are, and <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> pads that can read a Web URL from an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> 
              placed on it.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> shadow. Right now <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              live either in the physical world or as icons on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen. 
              User <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> designers still debate whether icons that appear 
              to be three-dimensional are better than ones that look two-dimensional. 
              Instead, the icons can really become three-dimensional; physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s can have logical behavior associated with them. A business 
              card should contain an address, but also summon a Web page if placed 
              near a Web <a class="thought" href="entries/browser_entry.html">browser</a>. A pen should write in normal ink, but also remember 
              what it writes so that the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> can be recalled later in 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, and it should serve as a stylus to control that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              A house key can also serve as a cryptographic key. Each of these 
              things has a useful physical function as well as a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> one.</p>
<p>My colleague Hiroshi Ishii has a group of industrial designers, 
              graphical designers, and user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> designers studying how to 
              build such new kinds of environmental <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>s. A recurring theme 
              is that interaction should happen in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> that you, rather 
              than the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, find meaningful. They use video projectors so 
              that tables and floors and walls can show relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>; 
              since Hiroshi is such a good Ping-Pong player, one of the first 
              examples was a Ping-Pong table that displayed the ball's trajectory 
              in a fast-moving game by connecting sensors in the table to a video 
              projector aimed down at the table. His student John Underkoffler 
              notes that a lamp is a one-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> display that can be either on or 
              off; John is replacing lightbulbs with combinations of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              video projectors and cameras so that the <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> can illuminate ideas 
              as well as spaces.</p>
<p>Many of the most interesting displays they use are barely perceptible, 
              such as a room for managing their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> that maps the 
              traffic into ambient sounds and visual cues. A soothing breeze indicates 
              that all is well; the sights and sounds of a thunderstorm is a sign 
              of an impending disaster that needs immediate attention. This <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              about their <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> is always available, but never demands 
              direct attention unless there is a problem.</p>
<p>Taken together, ambient displays, tagged <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, and remote sensing 
              of people have a simple interpretation: the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> as a distinguishable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> disappears. Instead of a fixed display, keyboard, and <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, 
              the things around us become the means we use to interact with <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> as well as the physical world. Today's battles between 
              competing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>s will 
              literally vanish into the woodwork as the <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> of the physical 
              world makes control of the desktop less relevant.</p>
<p>This is really no more than Piaget's original premise of <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              through manipulation, filtered through Papert and Kay. We've gotten 
              stuck at the developmental stage of early infants who use one hand 
              to point at things in their world, a decidedly small subset of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. Things we do well rely on all of our senses.</p>
<p>Children, of course, understand this. The first lesson that any 
              technologist bringing <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s into a classroom gets taught by 
              the kids is that they don't want to sit still in front of a tube. 
              They want to play, in groups and alone, wherever their fancy takes 
              them. The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has to tag along if it is to participate. This 
              is why Mitch Resnick, who has carried on Seymour's tradition at 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, has worked so hard to squeeze a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> into a Lego 
              brick. These bring the malleability of computing to the interactivity 
              of a Lego <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a>.</p>
<p>Just as Alan's <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> for kids was quickly taken over by the 
              grown-ups, Lego has been finding that adults are as interested as 
              kids in their smart bricks. There's no end to the <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> that's 
              found <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> through them; my favorite is a descendent of the 
              old LOGO turtle, a copier made from a Lego car that drives over 
              a page with a <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> sensor and then trails a pen to draw a copy 
              of the page.</p>
<p>A window is actually an apt metaphor for how we use <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s now. 
              It is a barrier between what is inside and what is outside. While 
              that can be useful at times (such as keeping bugs where they belong), 
              it's confining to stay behind it. <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">Windows</a> also open to let'fresh 
              air in and let people out.</p>
<p>All along the coming <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> has been apparent. The 
              mistake was to assume that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> happens between 
              a person sitting at a desk and a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> sitting on the desk. We 
              didn't just miss the forest for the trees, we missed the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> and 
              the sky and everything else. The world is the next <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>.</p>
