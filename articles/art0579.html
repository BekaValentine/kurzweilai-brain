<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>I have a vested interest in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, because I plan on living 
              there. I want to help create one in which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can meet the 
              needs of people, rather than the other way around. As more and more 
              gadgets demand our attention, the promises of the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Revolution 
              start to sound more like those of a disinformation campaign. A counterrevolution 
              seeks to protect our <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> to not be <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a>. But rather than ask 
              whether reading is better done with a book or a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, I want 
              to show how to <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> the best features of each.</p>
<p>This modest aim has radical implications, and regrettably little 
              precedent. Putting ink on paper, and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on a <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a>, are separated 
              by a divide between the old <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> world of atoms and the new <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              world of bits. The existing organization of industry and academia, 
              of scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and product development, serves to enforce 
              rather than dismantle that distinction. I've spent my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> being 
              gently and not-so-gently steered away from the equally great problems 
              and opportunities that lie neglected at the boundary between the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and its physical representation.</p>
<p>In high school I fell in <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> . . . with the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop. This 
              was the one class in which I showed some promise. Then the curriculum 
              split, with the college-bound students sitting in classrooms, and 
              the vocational students going off to a trade school where they could 
              use an even better <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop, and make <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s, and assemble 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s, and build houses. There was no competition&#8212;<i>that's</i> 
              what I wanted to do. With some effort I was persuaded to stick with 
              the college track, but I couldn't understand why making things had 
              to be separated from <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> about things. I still don't. At Bell 
              Labs I was threatened with a grievance for daring to leave my lab 
              and approach the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools in the unionized shop, which was 
              intended for the trade school graduates rather than the college 
              graduates.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate I migrated from studying <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> 
              to ask deep questions about the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, to studying <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to answer deep questions about the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and eventually 
              ended up back in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop in the basement of the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering 
              building rediscovering the joys of manipulating things rather than 
              ideas. In <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> grad school I figured out that theorists weren't 
              allowed in the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> shop, but <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>alists were allowed to 
              do theory, so the only way to do both was to claim to be an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>alist.</p>
<p>I was officially a physicist by the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> I visited the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab 
              to develop sensors to <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> Yo-Yo Ma's cello to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. 
              This prompted some people to ask me a question I never understood: 
              "That's fine, but is it <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>?" I could answer it, explaining 
              where the traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> occurred. But I didn't want to, much 
              preferring to discuss the remarkable consequences of connecting 
              Yo-Yo to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab I didn't see it as a place to do 
              "real" <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, but it was only there that I was able to bring together 
              these disconnected pieces. This was finally a place where I could 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a lab that put <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> tools, theoretical physicists, and 
              musicians in the same room at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. As it began filling 
              with students and sponsors, I was delighted to find that I was not 
              alone in struggling to bridge rather than bound the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> and 
              physical worlds.</p>
<p>Emerging from this effort is a vision of a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> that is much 
              more <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible, connected, expressive, and responsive, as well 
              as many of the ingredients needed to realize the vision. This book 
              tells that story. I feel safe in making these predictions about 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> because they're really observations about the present. 
              In the laboratory and in product development pipelines, <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              is moving out of traditional <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and into the world around 
              us, a change that is much more significant than the arrival of multimedia 
              or the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> because it touches on so much more of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the book revolves around the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, because much of 
              my <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> does. Although this book is a personal statement, it owes 
              a deep debt to the dear community of colleagues, students, and sponsors 
              there who have shaped these ideas. I describe global changes that 
              still have too few local environments that are as supportive of 
              bringing bits and atoms together. My hope is that the book's focus 
              will come to appear to be parochial, as the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab's role becomes 
              less unique.</p>
<p>This book reflects recurring <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a>s that I've had with ordinary 
              people about how the world around them does and will work, with 
              industrial managers trying to navigate through coming business threats 
              to reach these new opportunities, and with <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers struggling 
              with emerging questions in new areas along with declining interest 
              and support in old ones. I've written for all three because I've 
              never been able to separate these parts of myself.</p>
<p>I will have succeeded if a shoe <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> comes to be seen as a 
              great idea and not just a <a class="thought" href="entries/joke_entry.html">joke</a>, if it becomes natural to recognize 
              that people and things have relative rights that are now routinely 
              infringed, if <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s disappear and the world becomes our <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>.</p>
