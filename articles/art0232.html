<div class="TeaserText">Does the optimism of technologists blur the question of quantitative improvements in hardware versus a lack of qualititative improvements in software? Do they point the way towards an eschatological cataclysm in which doom is imminent?</div>
<br>
<br><p>Read Ray Kurzweil's response <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060116180014/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0236.html" target="_self">here</a>. A postscript on Ray Kurzweil can be read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060116180014/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0233.html" target="_self">here</a>. Originally published September 2000 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060116180014/http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge74.html" target="_new">Edge</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 30, 2001.</p>
<p>For the last twenty years, I have found myself on the inside of a revolution, but on the outside of its resplendent dogma. Now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream, but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy, it's probably <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than I have before. And so I'll here share my <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s with the respondents of edge.org, many of whom are, as much as anyone, responsible for this revolution, one which champions the assent of cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> as culture.</p>
<p>The dogma I object to is composed of a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of interlocking beliefs and doesn't have a generally accepted overarching name as yet, though I sometimes call it "cybernetic totalism." It has the potential to transform <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> experience more powerfully than any prior ideology, <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, or political <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> ever has, partly because it can be so pleasing to the mind, at least initially, but mostly because it gets a free ride on the overwhelmingly powerful technologies that happen to be created by people who are, to a large degree, true believers.</p>
<p>Edge readers might be surprised by my use of the word "cybernetic." I find the word problematic, so I'd like to explain why I chose it. I <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ed for a term that united the diverse ideas I was exploring, and also connected current <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> and culture with earlier generations of thinkers who touched on similar topics. The original usage of "cybernetic", as by Norbert Weiner, was certainly not restricted to <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. It was originally meant to suggest a metaphor between marine navigation and a feedback <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> that governs a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, such as a thermostat. Weiner certainly recognized and humanely explored the extraordinary reach of this metaphor, one of the most powerful ever expressed.</p>
<p>I hope no one will think I'm equating <a class="thought" href="entries/cybernetics_entry.html">Cybernetics</a> and what I'm calling Cybernetic Totalism. The distance between recognizing a great metaphor and treating it as the only metaphor is the same as the distance between humble <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and dogmatic <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>. Here is a partial roster of the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> beliefs of cybernetic totalism:</p>
<p>1) That cybernetic patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality. </p>
<p>2) That people are no more than cybernetic patterns. </p>
<p>3) That <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect. </p>
<p>4) That what Darwin described in <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, or something like it, is in fact also the singular, superior description of all <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> and culture. </p>
<p>5) That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be inexorably accelerated by <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>. </p>
<p>And finally, the most dramatic: </p>
<p>6) That <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> will merge with <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> (becoming <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>), resulting in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> and the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> becoming mercurial; achieving the supposed <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. Furthermore, all of this will happen very soon! Since <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are improving so quickly, they will overwhelm all the other cybernetic processes, like people, and will fundamentally change the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of what's going on in the familiar neighborhood of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> at some moment when a new "criticality" is achieved- maybe in about the year 2020. To be a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> after that moment will be either impossible or something very different than we now can know.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years a stream of books has gradually informed the larger public about the belief structure of the inner circle of Digerati, starting softly, for instance with Godel, Escher, Bach, and growing more harsh with recent entries such as The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a> by Ray Kurzweil.</p>
<p>Recently, public attention has finally been drawn to #6, the astonishing belief in an eschatological cataclysm in our lifetimes, brought about when <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s become the ultra-intelligent masters of physical <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. So far as I can tell, a large number of my friends and colleagues believe in some version of this imminent doom.</p>
<p>I am quite curious who, among the eminent thinkers who largely accept some version of the first five points, are also comfortable with the sixth idea, the <a class="thought" href="entries/eschatology_entry.html">eschatology</a>. In general, I find that technologists, rather than natural scientists, have tended to be vocal about the possibility of a near-term criticality. I have no idea, however, what figures like <a class="thought" href="entries/dawkins_entry.html">Richard Dawkins</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/dennett_entry.html">Daniel Dennet</a>t make of it. Somehow I can't imagine these elegant theorists speculating about whether nanorobots might take over the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> in twenty years. It seems beneath their dignity. And yet, the eschatologies of Kurzweil, Moravec, and Drexler follow directly and, it would seem, inevitably, from an understanding of the world that has been most sharply articulated by none other than Dawkins and Dennett. Do Dawkins, Dennett, and others in their camp see some flaw in <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a> that insulates their <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> from the eschatological implications? The primary candidate for such a flaw as I see it is that cyber-armageddonists have confused ideal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s with real <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, which behave differently. My position on this point can be evaluated separately from my admittedly provocative positions on the first five points, and I hope it will be.</p>
<p>Why this is only "one half of a manifesto": I hope that readers will not think that I've sunk into some sort of glum rejection of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. In fact, I'm more delighted than ever to be working in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer science</a> and I find that it's rather easy to adopt a humanistic framework for designing <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> tools. There is a lovely global flowering of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> culture already in place, arising for the most independently of the technological elites, which implicitly rejects the ideas I am attacking here. A full manifesto would attempt to describe and promote this positive culture.</p>
<p>I will now examine the five beliefs that must precede acceptance of the new <a class="thought" href="entries/eschatology_entry.html">eschatology</a>, and then consider the <a class="thought" href="entries/eschatology_entry.html">eschatology</a> itself.</p>
<p>Here we go:</p>
<p>Cybernetic Totalist Belief #1: That cybernetic patterns of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality.</p>
<p>There is an undeniable rush of excitement experienced by those who first are able to perceive a phenomenon cybernetically. For example, while I believe I can imagine what a thrill it must have been to use early photographic equipment in the 19th century, I can't imagine that any outsider could comprehend the sensation of being around early <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> graphics <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in the nineteen-seventies. For here was not merely a way to make and show images, but a metaframework that subsumed all possible images. Once you can understand something in a way that you can shove it into a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, you have cracked its <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>, transcended any particularity it might have at a given <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. It was as if we had become the Gods of vision and had effectively created all possible images, for they would merely be reshufflings of the bits in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s we had before us, completely under our command.</p>
<p>The cybernetic impulse is initially driven by ego (though, as we shall see, in its end game, which has not yet arrived, it will become the enemy of ego). For instance, Cybernetic Totalists look at culture and see "memes", or autonomous mental tropes that compete for <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> in humans somewhat like viruses. In doing so they not only accomplish a triumph of "campus imperialism", placing themselves in an imagined position of superior understanding vs. the whole of the humanities, but they also avoid having to pay much attention to the particulars of culture in a given <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and place. Once you have subsumed something into its cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a>, any particular reshuffling of its bits seems unimportant.</p>
<p>Belief #1 appeared on the stage almost immediately with the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. It was articulated by the first generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientists; Weiner, Shannon, Turing. It is so fundamental that it isn't even stated anymore within the inner circle. It is so well rooted that it is difficult for me to remove myself from my all-encompassing intellectual environment long enough to articulate an alternative to it.</p>
<p>An alternative might be this: A cybernetic model of a phenomenon can never be the sole favored model, because we can't even build <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s that conform to such models. Real <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are completely different from the ideal <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s of theory. They break for <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that are not always analyzable, and they seem to intrinsically resist many of our endeavors to improve them, in large part due to legacy and lock-in, among other problems. We imagine "pure" cybernetic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s but we can only prove we know how to build fairly dysfunctional ones. We kid ourselves when we think we understand something, even a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, merely because we can model or digitize it.</p>
<p>There is also an epistemological problem that bothers me, even though my colleagues by and large are willing to ignore it. I don't think you can measure the function or even the existence of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> without a cultural <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for it. I don't think Martians would necessarily be able to distinguish a Macintosh from a <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> heater.</p>
<p>The above disputes ultimately turn on a combination of technical arguments about <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">information theory</a> and philosophical positions that largely arise from taste and faith.</p>

Like I see fear based technology growing upon us, how will the human spirit change under the influence of so much more big brother, connectedness, socalled security etc. I feel sorry for the kids that are kind of protected from real-time endeavours, dangers, risk etc. Who grows up avoiding risk (or excluded from it) might tend to act as a austriche when older, or is this exactly what we already see?
