              in a highly comprehensive though very personal <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>. 
              To create such a functional <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for the coming century, 
              we must find ways to break down long-standing <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al shortcomings:</p>
<p><b>Problem <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">Set</a> 1:</b><br>
              &#183; Faster and slower students are alienated because teaching 
              is aimed at the average student <br>
              &#183; Less aggressive students learn less<br>
              &#183; Teachers don't have <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to give <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ized instruction<br>
<b>Solution 1 - Customize the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process</b></p>
<p><b>Problem <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">Set</a> 2:</b><br>
              &#183; Students don't <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> enough<br>
              &#183; Students have trouble visualizing abstract <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s<br>
              &#183; Students don't utilize enough of their senses<br>
              &#183; Students don't utilize balance and coordination when <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a><br>
<b>Solution 2 - Utilize the senses and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> more</b></p>
<b>Problem <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">Set</a> 3:</b><br>
            &#183; Disciplines are too separate<br>
            &#183; There is too much emphasis on grades, rules and directions 
            rather than <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a><br>
            &#183; The arts have taken a superfluous position in <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a><br>
            &#183; Too few students are interested in <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a><br>
<b>Solution 3 - Foster a heightened <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of curiosity</b><br>
<h3>Adventure <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a></h3>
<p>The drawbacks listed above can be resolved by customizing the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> 
              process, allowing students to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> more, and fostering a heightened 
              level of curiosity. Students should pursue their own inspiration 
              and learn at their own levels. It is a well-known fact that we learn 
              more by doing. But how can we be <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>ly exposed to many different 
              ideas or places? By developing a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> for students to <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              more through increased usage of their senses. </p>
<p>Students should be compelled more toward seeking creative solutions 
              than merely following instructions. Let's allow rivers of subjects 
              to mingle in a confluence of endless possibilities and in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, 
              incorporate rather than separate the arts. How can <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> help 
              us overcome past <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al problems, including those caused by 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> itself?</p>

<p><b>Iona enters the Tangitrek. With a force feedback exoskeleton, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> base, gimbaled harness and autostereoscopic display, a student 
              can go anywhere and do anything.<br>
</b> </p>
<p><i>Fast-forward to the 2020's. A 12-year-old student walks up a 
              curving entry <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> and enters a Tangitrek, which biometrically 
              identifies her as Iona Sole. A 10-foot sphere envelops her after 
              the entry <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a> rotates out of the way. Iona, who has two years 
              of Adventure <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, makes some selections. The <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              will accommodate and keep track of her preferences and skill levels 
              in different areas. Like many students, Iona's focus used to be 
              more on getting good grades than <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a>. Now that she's developed 
              a strong desire to learn, she is already several years ahead of 
              turn of the millennium <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al standards for her age.<br>

<p><b>Utilize the Senses and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">Experience</a> More</b><i><br>

<p><i>As we continue to increase our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> through an accelerating 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of virtual techniques, we rapidly lose touch with the tangible 
              world. By further advancing our simulation capabilities we will 
              actually bring real world challenges back into the virtual <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>.<br>
</i><i><br>
              The sphere Iona is now inside is the inner of a three-ring gimbal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that allows her complete <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> of rotation. The outer ring 
              is attached to a three-degree-of-<a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> base that enhances 
              her <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of acceleration by moving up and down, side to side, and 
              forward and back. Iona sits on a small seat and is gently enveloped 
              by a body harness whose sensors make minute size adjustments and 
              lock into place. The body harness is an intelligent force feedback 
              exoskeleton. </i></p>
<p><i>Twenty years ago this haptic, or touch <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was used for 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> sculpting and surgical simulation. Now Iona can feel <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, 
              step on surfaces, and fly through spaces. <br>
              Like all students, Iona eagerly begins her adventure with her ongoing 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> exploration project. From there she will traverse <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              branches which help to solve problems for her personal project or 
              enlighten her to related subjects. Iona, an enthusiast of ancient 
              mythology, has been studying the theoretical <a class="thought" href="entries/genetics_entry.html">genetics</a> of creating

<p><i>In her visualization class, where students are coached in picturing

              head in an effort to exercise more of her <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and to avoid over-immersion. 
              </i></p>
<p><i>Iona begins where she left off by selecting and boarding a virtual 
              mobile scaffold&#8212;not unlike a surfboard&#8212;on which she 
              navigates through a giant model of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. She deftly arranges and

<h3>A sneak preview of next-generation education technology</h3>
<p>Visitors to the <i>Corkscrew Hill</i> film ride at Busch Gardens 
              in Williamsburg, Virginia are already experiencing a taste of what 
              immersive 3-D virtual learning environments of the future might 
              be like. </p>

<p><b>The 3-D <i>Corkscrew Hill</i> adventure starts inside a box 
              discovered by two boys</b></p>
<p>Set in an Irish castle, the 4-D ride combines motion simulation 
              with computer-animated, high-resolution digital 3-D stereographic 
              images projected on giant screens and special theatrical effects 
              to transport the audience into an imaginative Irish mythical tale. 
              <br>
</p>
<p> Diana Walczak, a classically trained sculptor and computer animation 
              artist, pioneered the use of haptic technology in creating the 3-D 
              characters, using FreeForm haptic (touch) software and the PHANTOM, 
              a tactile force-feedback interface that simulates physical sculpting 
              using virtual clay in the computer, both from SensAble Technologies.

<p><b>Walczak "sculpts" 3-D digital images for "Corkscrew 
              Hill," using haptic technology</b></p>
<p>Walczak, co-director of computer-animation production house <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080316190442/http://kwcc.com/" target="_blank">Kleiser-Walczak</a>, 
              also used this system to sculpt the characters in Santa Lights Up 
              New York, a 3-D stereoscopic film for The Radio City Christmas Spectacular 
              that takes the audience on a magical aerial ride around New York 
              City. <br>

<p>Other state-of-the-art 3-D Kleiser-Walczak projects include the 
              <i>Honey I shrunk the Audience</i> attraction at Disney's Epcot 
              Center, Douglas Trumbull's <i>Luxor Trilogy</i> at the Luxor Hotel 
              in Las Vegas, the first computer graphics/live-action ride film, 
              and the acclaimed <i>The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man</i> attraction 
              at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando.</p>

<p>Kleiser-Walczak is also noted for visual effects for the metamorph 
              Mystique in <i>X-Men</i> (they're working on <i>X-Men 2</i>, to 
              be released in 2003), the stargate sequence in the <i>Stargate</i> 
              film, and the face replacement effects in <i>The One</i>, along 
              with animations for <i>Honey, I blew Up The Kid</i>, <i>Mortal Kombat: 
              Annihilation</i>, <i>Clear and Present Danger</i>, <i>The Rage: 
              Carrie 2</i>, and the first 3-D stunt doubles, in <i>Judge Dredd</i>.</p>
<p>The company also collaborated with Ray Kurzweil on an interactive 
              project that required the studio to create two virtual models for 
              Kurzweil's performance as his female alter ego, Ramona, at the TED11 
              Conference. </p>

<br>
Several years ago, I wrote a fictional story called the Virtual Angler, based on just such a concept of education in the future, and I was surprised to see how similar the ideas were.  Although I know education and fly fishing, my sci fi is pretty pathetic.  However, after reading this article I'm inspired to research more and possibly turn the story into a juvenile novel.  Thanks!</p></td>
