<div class="TeaserText">The best way to reduce risks from molecular manufacturing would be an open, international R&amp;D program with broad cooperation by the democracies, including a parallel arms control verification project. This requires a decision to pursue the goal and substantial funding.  But both of these are currently blocked by the lack of consensus on the technical feasibility of molecular manufacturing. So we urgently need a basic feasibility review by unbiased scientists.</div>

<p><i>Testimony presented April 9, 2003 at the Committee on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>, 
              U.S. House of Representatives Hearing to examine the societal implications 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and consider H.R. 766, The <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 
              and Development Act of 2003.</i></p>
<p>First, I'd like to thank the Committee on <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> for taking on 
              the task of addressing the societal implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. This challenging topic may emerge as the most difficult issue facing 
              policymakers over the coming decades.</p>
<p>Humanity's drive to improve our control of the physical world is 
              intrinsic to our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and has been in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> for millennia. 
              &#160;A vast international economic and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> momentum pushes us toward 
              the ultimate goal of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>: complete control of the physical 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, all the way down to the atomic level.</p>
<h2>Confusion about <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a></h2>
<p>Before attempting to address societal issues, we need to clarify 
              which stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is being examined. Today the word 
              is used in two very different ways:</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Near-term <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>:&#160; Industry today uses the term to cover 
              almost any <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> significantly smaller than microtechnology, 
              e.g. nanoparticles. These new products will have positive and negative 
              health and environmental effects which should be studied, but their 
              societal effects&amp;#8212both positive and negative&#8212;will be modest 
              compared to later stages of the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>: <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> enabling broad control at 
              the level of <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> atoms: "The essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              is the ability to work at the molecular level...to create large 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s with fundamentally new molecular organization." 
              (ref 1)&#160; It is this stage of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> which will have major 
              societal impact, and the remainder of this testimony will focus 
              here.</p>
<h2>Molecular manufacturing: the long-term goal</h2>
<p>Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, known as <i>molecular manufacturing</i>, 
              will give the ability to construct a wide range of large <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s 
              inexpensively and with atomic precision. It will take us beyond 
              materials and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s to complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              inspired by&amp;#8212but in some ways superior to&#8212;those found in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>.</p>
<p>Molecular manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can be envisioned as factories 
              operating at the nanometer level, including nanoscale conveyor belts 
              and robotic arms bringing molecular parts together precisely, bonding 
              them to form products with every <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> in a precise, designed location 
              (ref 2).</p>
<p>It is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant not to minimize the technical challenge of such 
              a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering project. Indeed, new tools must be 
              developed before beginning a direct attack on the problem. Nonetheless, 
              ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is building the needed <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> base, and will 
              eventually place enormous payoffs within reach.</p>
<p>These prospects have been known since the first technical publication 
              on the topic in 1981 (ref 3), and substantial <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> has been devoted 
              to potential societal implications of molecular manufacturing. <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> was founded in 1986 to maximize the societal 
              benefits and minimize the problems expected from advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<h2>Potential benefits of molecular manufacturing</h2>
<p>Gaining molecular-level control over the <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> will 
              bring a wide variety of positive applications (ref 4):</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Medical uses</b>: Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will be able to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> and rearrange <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, providing 
              the tools needed to bring about a state of health, regardless of 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>'s cause (ref 5).</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Environmental applications</b>: Using molecular manufacturing 
              techniques, it will be possible to construct our products with zero 
              chemical pollution, recycling leftover <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s. Environmental 
              restoration could be carried out at the molecular level, detecting 
              and inactivating unwanted chemicals (ref 6).</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Raising sustainable living standards</b>:&#160; Molecular manufacturing 
              will be able to cleanly and inexpensively produce high-quality products 
              using common materials (especially <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>, which is in excess in 
              the atmosphere in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> dioxide) and solar <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> (ref 
              6).</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Low cost to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a></b>:&#160; The strong, lightweight 
              materials enabled by molecular manufacturing will greatly lower 
              the cost of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> resources, making their active 
              use affordable for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>These benefits should be attainable though the combined results 
              of (1) a well-funded R&amp;D <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, (2) private sector efforts 
              to bring down costs, and (3) public policy aimed at addressing the 
              issues listed below.</p>
<h2>Potential negative effects of molecular manufacturing</h2>
<p>Powerful technologies bring problems as well as benefits, and advanced 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies are expected to bring problems of several sorts:</p>
<p><b>&#8226; Accidents</b>:&#160; Any powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>&amp;#8212from fire to 
              biotech&#8212;must be controlled to avoid accidents. In the case 
              of molecular manufacturing, rearranging <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at the molecular 
              level can either improve or destroy a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s able to build complex <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s could build copies of themselves, 
              possibly overdoing this activity from a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> point of view, as 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> do.</p>
<p><b>An approach to the problem:</b>&#160; This issue has been examined 
              and a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of safety rules has been drafted for review; these are 
              expected to evolve as we gain more <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about safety issues 
              (ref 7). <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">Implement</a>ation will require the cooperation of the private 
              sector, and early endorsement of safety guidelines could ease public 
              concerns about the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. </p>
<p><b>&#8226; Economic disruption:&#160; </b>Technological change continually 
              disrupts employment <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, but molecular manufacturing is expected 
              to accelerate this significantly: once certain specific points of 
              development in this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are reached, very rapid change can 
              take place.</p>
<p><b>An approach to the problem:</b>&#160; Increase workforce flexibility 
              through <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> and training.</p>
<p><b>&#8226; Lack of <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>:&#160; </b>Excessive or incorrect <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>ing of fundamental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> parts at the nanoscale may reduce <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> competition 
              and make molecular manufacturing products too expensive for many 
              to benefit.</p>
<p><b>An approach to the problem:</b>&#160; Increase private sector competition 
              by discouraging <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>ing of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> parts needed 
              by all companies doing molecular manufacturing. Consider using 
              "open source"-style <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> protection for 
              publicly-funded R&amp;D so that this work is available to all (ref 
              8).</p>
<p><b>&#8226; Deliberate abuse/<a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a>: </b>Of the potential problems 
              molecular manufacturing may bring, this is regarded as the most 
              serious and most challenging to address. Three main areas of concern 
              have been identified: (1) very rapid construction of conventional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, making traditional arms control more difficult, (2) totalitarian 
              control of civilian populations by surveillance using nanoscale 
              sensors, and (3) new <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s made possible by the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, which 
              can be <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> of as "smart" chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s.</p>
<p><b>An approach to the problem:</b>&#160; Encourage an open, international 
              R&amp;D <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> with broad cooperation by the democracies, including 
              a parallel arms control verification project (ref 6). Improve today's 
              chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s arms control procedures.</p>
<h2>Reducing risks from molecular manufacturing</h2>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">Individual</a>s and organizations with legitimate concerns regarding 
              advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> have suggested delays in development, even 
              moratoria or bans. While these reactions are understandable, this 
              approach was examined over a decade ago and rejected as infeasible 
              (ref 4). Today, both public and private spending on <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              is broadly international. Expected economic and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> advantages 
              are driving a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race already underway. If law-abiding 
              nations choose to delay <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> development, they will relinquish 
              the lead to others.</p>
<p>Non-U.S. locations have at least three advantages in the <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> 
              race: (1) labor costs for scientists and technologists are usually 
              lower, (2) <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> rules are sometimes ignored, and 
              (3) the former "brain drain" of technical talent to the 
              U.S. is slowing and in some cases reversing. The U.S. and other 
              democracies have no natural monopoly in developing this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, 
              and failure to develop it would amount to unilateral disarmament.</p>
<p>In developing a powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, delay may seem to add safety, 
              but the opposite could be the case for molecular manufacturing. A targeted R&amp;D project today aimed at this goal would need to 
              be large and, therefore, visible and relatively easy to monitor. As <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> passes, the nanoscale infrastructure improves worldwide, 
              enabling faster development everywhere, including places that are 
              hard to monitor. The safest course may be to create a fast-moving, 
              well-funded, highly-focused project located where it can be closely 
              watched by all interested parties. Estimates are that such a project 
              could reach its goal in 10-15 years.</p>
<h2>Specific ethical considerations</h2>
<p>A study of ethical implications of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> would 
              need to address at least these factors:</p>
<p><b>&#8226; </b>The different kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and their likely 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/windows_entry.html">windows</a> of impact,</p>
<p><b>&#8226; </b>A wide spectrum of different scenarios, including ones 
              in which a significant molecular manufacturing R&amp;D project is 
              already in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> elsewhere,</p>
<p><b>&#8226; </b>The potential consequences of "saying no" to 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, as well as those of saying yes. These may be unevenly 
              distributed; for example, those in poor countries might be hurt 
              more by a delay&amp;#8212especially of environmental applications&#8212;than 
              those in the U.S.</p>
<p><b>&#8226; </b>In most cases, <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> does not "say no" or 
              "yes" to a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, but instead moves forward with 
              appropriate controls. Ethical issues arise in defining the dimensions 
              and consequences of such controls.</p>
<p><b>&#8226; </b>To date, the dialog around <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> has been polarized, 
              with only one viewpoint&#8212;near-term <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>&amp;#8212being 
              included in policymaking. A meaningful discussion of <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> and 
              consequences requires us to ensure that a wide variety of opinions 
              are represented in any downstream policy body or Presidential Commission 
              on <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>.</p>
<h2>Bottleneck: Lack of feasibility review</h2>
<p>While the basics of molecular manufacturing have been in the literature 
              for over a decade, controversy still continues about the technical 
              feasibility of this goal. </p>
<p><b>We urgently need a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> feasibility review in which molecular

<p>If we are in fact on the pathway to building molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, with all the benefits and problems that implies, policymakers 
              need to know now in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to respond appropriately as this opportunity 
              approaches.</p>
<p>The United States has a <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of technological success in large 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering projects&#8212;it has been one of our primary 
              strengths. But <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is already worldwide, and 
              there is no guarantee that the U.S, an ally, or other democracy 
              will be the first to reach molecular manufacturing, and failure 
              to do so would be militarily disastrous.</p>
<p>Such an ambitious R&amp;D project requires, first, a decision to 
              pursue the goal, and then substantial funding. Both of these are 
              currently blocked by the lack of consensus on the technical feasibility 
              of molecular manufacturing. Until this issue has been put to rest, 
              neither a funded molecular manufacturing R&amp;D project nor effective 
              study of societal implications can be carried out.</p>
