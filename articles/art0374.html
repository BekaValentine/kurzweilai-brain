<p>
<b>The Significance of the </b><b><a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a></b><b>.</b> The implicit, and in my view brilliant, insight in Turing's eponymous test is the ability of written <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> to represent <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>. The basis of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is that if the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> judge is competent, then an <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> requires <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to pass the test. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> judge is free to probe each candidate with regard to their understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, current events, aspects of the candidate's personal <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s, as well as their <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>s, all expressed through written <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>. As humans jump from one <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> and one <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> to the next, it is possible to quickly touch upon all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, on all aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, well, humanness.</p>
<p>To the extent that the "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>" chooses to reveal its "<a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>" during the interview with the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> judge (note that none of the contestants are required to reveal their histories), the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> will need to use a fictional <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> because "it" will not be in a position to be honest about its origins as a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and pass the test. (By the way, I put the word "it" in quotes because it is my view that once an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> does indeed pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>, we may very well consider "it" to be a "he" or a "she.") This makes the task of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s somewhat more difficult than that of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> foils because the humans can use their own <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. As fiction writers will attest, presenting a totally convincing <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> that is credible and tracks coherently is a challenging task that most humans are unable to accomplish successfully. However, some humans are capable of doing this, and it will be a necessary task for a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>.</p>
<p>There are many contemporary examples of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s passing "narrow" forms of the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, that is, demonstrating <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in specific <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s. For example, Gary Kasparov, clearly a qualified judge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, declared that he found <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>'s playing skill to be indistinguishable from that of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> master during the famous tournament in which he was defeated by <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s are now displaying <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a growing array of <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s, including medical diagnosis, financial investment decisions, the design of products such as jet <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s, and a myriad of other tasks that previously required humans to accomplish. We can say that such "narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>" is the threshold that the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> has currently achieved. However, the subtle and supple skills required to pass the broad <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> as originally described by Turing is far more difficult than any narrow <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a>. In my view, there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of tricks or simpler <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s simpler than those underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>) that would enable a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to pass a properly designed <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> without actually possessing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> at a fully <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of philosophical discussion and speculation concerning the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, and whether or not we should consider a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> that passed the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> to be conscious. Clearly, the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is not an explicit test for <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Rather, it is a test of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level performance. My own view is that inherently there is no <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive test for <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a> (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>) that does not have philosophical assumptions built into it. The <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for this has to do with the difference between the <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive and <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>. However, it is also my view that once <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> does achieve a fully <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, such that it can pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>, humans will treat such entities as if they were conscious. After all, they (the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s) will get mad at us if we don't. However, this is a political prediction rather than a philosophical position.</p>
<p>It is also <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to note that once a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> does achieve a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, it will necessarily soar past it. <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">Electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s are already at least 10 million times faster than the electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in our interneuronal connections. <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">Machine</a>s can share <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> instantly, whereas we <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humans do not have quick <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing ports on our <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> concentration levels, interneuronal connection <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, nor any other <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> bases of our <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> and skill. <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a>-capable <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> vast and accurate <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>s, including reading and mastering all the literature and sources of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> available to our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>. Thus "<a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing Test</a> level" <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be able to combine <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> with the powerful ways in which <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s already excel. In addition, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will continue to grow exponentially in their <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. It will be a formidable combination.</p>
<p>
<b>Why I Think I Will Win.</b> In considering the question of when <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a>) <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> will match the subtle and supple powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, we need to consider two interrelated but distinct questions: when will <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s have the <i><a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a></i> <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to match <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing, and when will our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> have mastered the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s, i.e., the <i><a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a></i> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. Without the latter, we would end up with extremely fast <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, and would not achieve the endearing qualities that characterize <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> discernment (nor the deep <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and command of <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> necessary to pass a full <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>!).</p>
<p>Both the <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> sides of this question are deeply influenced by the exponential <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies. The <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> that we see manifest in "<a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>" is far more pervasive than commonly understood. Our first observation is that the shrinking of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>, which is the principle of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>, was not the first but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> to computing (after electromechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relay-based <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>-based computing, and discrete <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s). Each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> one approach begins to run out of steam, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> efforts intensify to find the next source of renewed <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s were made smaller until it was no longer feasible to maintain a <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a>, which led to <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s). Thus the power and <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of technologies, particularly <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies, grow as a cascade of S-curves: <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> leading to an asymptote, leading to <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> (i.e., innovation), and another S-curve. Moreover, the underlying theory of the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-based technologies, which I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>, as well as a detailed examination of the underlying <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, show that there is a second level of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a>, i.e., the rate of <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> is itself growing exponentially<sup>i</sup>.</p>
<p>Second, this <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> of ongoing <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> through a cascade of S-curves is far broader than <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>. We see the same double <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> in a wide range of technologies, including <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies (<a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a>), <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> technologies (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> base-pair sequencing), <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, and of particular <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance to the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning, <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al and <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> region modeling).</p>
<p>Within the next approximately fifteen years, the current <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> will come to an end because by that <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the key <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> features will only be a few atoms in width. However, there are already at least two dozen projects devoted to the next (i.e., the sixth) <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>, which is to compute in three-dimensions. <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">Integrated circuit</a>s are dense but flat. We live in a three-dimensional world, our brains are organized in three dimensions, and we will soon be computing in three dimensions. The feasibility of three-dimensional computing has already been demonstrated in several landmark projects, including the particularly powerful approach of nanotube-based <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. However, for those who are (irrationally) skeptical of the potential for three-dimensional computing, it should be pointed out that achieving even a conservatively high estimate of the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> (i.e., one hundred billion <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s times a thousand connections per <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> times 200 <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>ly controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> "transactions" per second, or about 20 million billion <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s per second) will be achieved by conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s prior to 2020.</p>
<p>It is correct to point out that achieving the "<a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>" of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is the more <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a>, and more difficult, challenge. On multiple levels, we are being guided in this effort by a grand project to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er (i.e., understand the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of) the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> itself. Just as the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a> accelerated (with the bulk of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> being sequenced in the last year of the project), the effort to reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is also growing exponentially, and is further along than most people realize. We already have highly detailed mathematical models of several dozen of the several hundred types of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s found in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. The resolution, <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_scan_entry.html">brain scan</a>ning is also growing exponentially. By combining the <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a> modeling and interconnection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> obtained from scanning, scientists have already reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered two dozen of the several hundred regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">Implement</a>ations of these reverse <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered models using contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> matches the performance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> regions that were recreated in significant detail. Already, we are in a early stage of being able to replace small regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> that have been damaged from <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> or disability using <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s (e.g., ventral posterior <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, subthalmic <a class="thought" href="entries/nucleus_entry.html">nucleus</a>, and ventral lateral thalamus <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a>s to counteract <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Parkinson\'s Disease')">Parkinson's Disease</a> and tremors from other neurological disorders, <a class="thought" href="entries/cochlear_implant_entry.html">cochlear implant</a>s, emerging <a class="thought" href="entries/retinal_implant_entry.html">retinal implant</a>s, and others).</p>
<p>If we combine the <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>s in <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, and <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a>, it is a conservative expectation that we will within 20 to 25 years be able to send tiny scanners the size of blood cells into the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> through the capillaries to observe interneuronal connection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and even <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> levels from up close. Even without such capillary-based scanning, the contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> scientists, (e.g., <a class="thought" href="entries/watts_entry.html">Lloyd Watts</a>, who has modeled over a dozen regions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>), is that the connections in a particular region follow distinct <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s, and that it is not necessary to see every connection in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to understand the massively parallel, <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> controlled <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s that characterize <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing in each region. The work of Watts and others has demonstrated another <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant insight, that once the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s in a <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> region are understood and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ed using contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al requirements for the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation requires on the <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of a thousand times less <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> than the theoretical potential of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s being simulated.</p>
<p>A careful analysis of the requisite trends shows that we will understand the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and be in a position to recreate its powers in synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s well within thirty years. The <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is self-organizing, which means that it is created with relatively little innate <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>. Most of its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> comes from its own interaction with a complex world. Thus it will be necessary to provide an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> with an <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> just as we do with a natural <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. But here the powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> can be brought to bear. Once we are able to master a process in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, it can perform its <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s at a much faster speed than <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. As I mentioned, contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s is already more than ten million times faster than the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>'s electrochemical <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processing. Once an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> masters <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> skills, it will be in a position to expand its <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> skills and general <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> by rapidly reading all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> literature and by absorbing the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> contained on millions of web sites. Also of great significance will be the ability of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to share their <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> instantly.</p>
<p>One challenge to our ability to master the apparent <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> is whether we are capable of building a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of this <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> without the brittleness that often characterizes very complex <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. This a valid concern, but the answer lies in emulating the ways of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. The initial design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is of a <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> that we can already manage. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is characterized by a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> with only 23 million bytes of useful <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> (that's what left of the 800 million <a class="thought" href="entries/byte_entry.html">byte</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> when you eliminate all of the redundancies, e.g., the sequence called "<a class="thought" href="entries/alu_entry.html">ALU</a>" which is repeated hundreds of thousands of times). 23 million bytes is smaller than <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> WORD. How is it, then, that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> with its 100 trillion connections can result from a <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> that is so small? The interconnection <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> alone is a million times greater than the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>.</p>
<p>The answer is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> specifies a <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of processes, each of which utilizes chaotic <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s (i.e., initial randomness, then <a class="thought" href="entries/self_organizing_entry.html">self-organization</a>) to increase the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> represented. It is known, for example, that the wiring of the interconnections follows a plan that includes a great deal of randomness. As the <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> person encounters her environment, the connections and the <a class="thought" href="entries/neurotransmitter_entry.html">neurotransmitter</a> level <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> self-organize to better represent the world, but the initial design is specified by a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that is not extreme in its <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>.</p>
<p>Thus we will not <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> link by link as in some massive <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>. Nor is it the case that we will simply <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a single genetic (i.e., <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary) <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> and have <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> at <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> levels automatically evolve itself. Rather we will <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up an intricate <a class="thought" href="entries/hierarchy_entry.html">hierarchy</a> of self-organizing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, based largely on the <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, and then provide for its <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. However, this <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> process can proceed hundreds if not thousands of times faster than the comparable process for humans.</p>
<p>Another challenge is that the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> must incorporate some other kind of "stuff" that is inherently impossible to recreate in a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. Penrose imagines that the intricate tubules in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s are capable of quantum based processes, although there is no evidence for this. I would point out that even if the tubules do exhibit quantum effects, there is nothing barring us from applying these same quantum effects in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. After all, we routinely use quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s in our <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s today. The <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, for example, is based on quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/tunneling_entry.html">tunneling</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is made of the same small list of <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>s that all <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s are comprised of. We are rapidly recreating the powers of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> substances and <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, including neurological <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, so there is little basis to expect that the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> relies on some nonengineerable essence for its capabilities. In some theories, this special "stuff" is associated with the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, e.g., the idea of a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> associated with each person. Although one may take this philosophical position, the effect is to separate <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> from the performance of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. Thus the absence of such a <a class="thought" href="entries/soul_entry.html">soul</a> may in theory have a bearing on the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, but would not prevent a <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a> from the performance abilities necessary to pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>.</p>
<p>Another challenge is that an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> must have a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like body in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to display <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-like responses. I agree that a body is <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant to provide a situated means to interact with the world. The requisite technologies to provide simulated or virtual bodies are also rapidly advancing. Indeed, we already have emerging replacements or <a class="thought" href="entries/augmentation_entry.html">augmentation</a>s for virtually every <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in our body. Moreover, humans will be spending a great deal of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in full immersion <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> environments incorporating all of the senses by 2029, so a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_body_entry.html">virtual body</a> will do just as well. Fundamentally, emulating our bodies in real or <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> is a less complex task than emulating our brains.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the challenge of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, the idea that although <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s may very well be able to master the more analytical cognitive abilities of humans, they inherently will never be able to master the decidedly illogical and much harder to characterize <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>. A slightly broader way of characterizing this challenge is to pose it in terms of "qualia," which refers essentially to the full range of <a class="thought" href="entries/subjective_experience_entry.html">subjective experience</a>s. Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> is assessing convincing reactions to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s and to qualia. The apparent difficulty of responding appropriately to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> and other qualia appears to be at least a significant part of Mitchell Kapor's hesitation to accept the idea of a Turing-capable <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. It is my view that understanding and responding appropriately to <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> is indeed the most complex thing that we do (with other types of qualia being if anything simpler to respond to). It is the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and is precisely the heart of the Turing challenge. Although <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is complex, it nonetheless remains a capability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, with our endocrine <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> adding only a small measure of additional <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> (and operating at a relatively low <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a>). All of my observations above pertain to the issue of <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, because that is the heart of what we are <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>. Thus, we can say that a side benefit of creating Turing-capable <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will be new levels of insight into ourselves.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think that Ray will win the bet, but perhaps not for the precise reasons that he states.
<br>
<br>
He seems to believe that "real AI" (i.e., human-level general intelligence) will follow from brain scanning and the ensuing detailed understanding of human intelligence.
<br>
<br>
It would seem that he is not so bullish on non-closely-brain-based approaches to AI.
<br>
<br>
I agree that both computer hardware and brain scanning will both be kick-ass before 2029, but will this be how AI comes about?  This is one possible path to "real AI", but it is far from the only one.  
<br>
<br>
I wish that Ray, given his position as a publicist of Singularitarian and futurist thinking, would give a little more attention to non-closely-brain-based approaches to "real AI", which do exist.
<br>
<br>
Indeed, this is a personal axe that I am grinding here.  But I think it is a very important axe ;&gt;   See www.goertzel.org/realaibook/ for some information on a forthcoming book summarizing radical current approaches to "real AI", none of which are based on the detailed results of brain scanning, although brain science is certainly one source of inspiration for this work.

I have no doubt that we can learn a lot from brain scans, particularly once we have scans with much higher spatial &amp; temporal resolution that is available now.  I have worked with EEG, PET and MEG data, and I know that the current state of the hardware is not enough to teach us more than very general lessons about how the mind works.
<br>
<br>
The difference between closely brain-inspired AI and non-closely-brain-inspired AI is pretty clear to me.  If you read the article on the Novamente AI Engine at www.realai.net you will see what I mean.  The question is whether one introduces data structures &amp; algorithms that one KNOWS can't be the way the brain "does it", but that seem to carry out similar functions to parts of the brain, in an abstract sense.  I do introduce such data structures and algorithms, hence I don't consider my work closely brain-based... though it's certainly loosely brain-inspired..

<br>
<br>
&gt; "The question is whether one introduces data structures &amp; algorithms that one KNOWS can't be the way the brain "does it", but that seem to carry out similar functions to parts of the brain, in an abstract sense."
<br>
<br>
Another way to phrase the question is, "At what level of functionality do we care to make distinctions, and why?"
<br>
<br>
If an artificial system is able to beat a 9-dan at Go, while debating the the finer issues of current political intrigues and painting a beautiful and original watercolor, I will be quite convinced that its intelligence is "on par" with my own (I cannot yet break into the dan ranks!).  Why will I care _how_ it is accomplished, if "intelligence" is all that is of interest?
<br>
<br>
If, however, we want to hold this creature to be a "sentience" (morally wrong to abuse or "kill", say) then we have a deeper problem.  Many will not care how closely you "mimic" the "actual processing" of a human brain, if the underlying physics is "too different".
<br>
<br>
To address those that complain (perhaps rightly) that any "algorithmic" simulacrum of intelligence will be limited by the incompleteness of "formal systems", I have the following thought exercise, really a fantasy.
<br>
<br>
I imagine that we have created "algorithmically constrained" robots, whose demonstrated intelligence is at least remarkable, and we divide these into two camps.  To one camp, we add an additional "organ" I will call a "gel-pack".  Perhaps this gel-pack is an electrolytic gel packed with billions of carbon nanotubes of varied lengths, and for which a million needles penetrate the gel to various depths and locations.  The gel-pack is treated like any other "sense organ", in that its "needles" are treated as I/O points for internal processing such as the eyes or ears, but is isolated entirely within the robot.  It merely (perhaps) acts as a "strange correlator"; as the rest of the "AI-system" goes about its business, activity potentials find their way into this gel-pack through certain needles, and "strangely" affect the potentials available at other needles.
<br>
<br>
The "AI" simply treats this gel-pack as if it were another "sensory/motor system", and as the robot-AI continues to learn through associations with the world, we would become increasingly unsure to what degree this "gel-pack was contributing to the overall state of the system.  And if these "gel-pack augmented" robots began to outperform their gel-deficient brothers ...
<br>
<br>
The point of this exercise is simply to elide the argument that "its all algorithmic, all syntactic manipulation."  To argue that "it cannot possibly be sentient or conscious, despite its observed behaviors" becomes far more problematic.  It bears down on at least one "crutch" employed by vitalists or theologeans that "it cannot be 'mind' because it is fully explicable".
<br>
<br>
Thoughts?
<br>

I think that the debate over whether programs can be sentient or not, will disappear fast after highly intelligent autonomous programs become well-knonw.
<br>
<br>
Really, how does any of us know that any other humans besides ourselves are conscious?  We don't (read Breakfast of Champions by Vonnegut ;).  We don't bother to agonize over this much either -- we're pragmatists about other humans' consciousness, and once real artificial general intelligences are around, we'll be pragmatists about their consciousness too.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Ben,
<br>
<br>
I strongly agree.  The rise of (at least) convincingly sentient artificials is inevitable, and even if some scientists would argue "not really sentient", you would have the problem of "sending the wrong message" to youth regarding behaviors, if you allowed obvious cruelty toward the "seemingly sentient".
<br>
<br>
"Oh child, do not worry, it does not really 'feel' pain or fright.  It has simply evolved its programming to scream and writhe like that as a 'survival ploy' when we undertake to disassemble it."

<br>
That would not cut it, and there we would be.

Regardless of the point of the test, which in Turing's case seems to be that if it fools a human it can be considered artificially intelligent, the fundamental reasoning behind the point seems severely flawed and from my perspective largely a joke.
<br>
<br>
I can only re-iterate that just because some computer thing fools a human, does not necessarily make that thing "intelligent". Being made up of complex conditional data structures and having access to huge amounts of data or "knowledge" does not necessarily amount to real or true intelligence.
<br>
<br>
This is the point I make about the Turing test. This test is not suited to measuring true AI, if we wish to elevate our view of such an AI to the levels of real intelligence in the real world.
<br>
<br>
Without explicitly defining all the test parameters and agreeing upon them, it is difficult to conclude that such a test could offer any conclusive and convincing proof one way or the other, of the presence of real AI.
<br>
<br>
From this point of view and in consideration of  the broad range of possible parameters that may pertain to such a test, one could easily use the test to claim for and against the presence of AI. Thus the test basically can not be relied upon in any reasonable way.

Surely it would not be hard to pass the Turing Test. Frankly I think it is a grossly outdated concept and a huge joke with severely flawed assumptions.
<br>
<br>
One fundamentally flawed assumption is the level of intellect and awareness of the person the AI simulation is trying to fool. For example,  a child may be more easily fooled by the an AI simulation than an adult. Thus the AI may pass the test with some people and fail it with others.
<br>
<br>
The other things is that simply being able to answer a set of questions says very little about real intelligence. Anything can be rope learnt by computers and people. Computer AIs generally rope learn anyway. This test is extremely subjective and unreliable.
<br>
<br>
Also a snail could have more "real intelligence" than many computer AIs, yet it would most likely fail the Turing test, as would a dog, a monkey and possibly even a dolphin.
<br>
<br>
Sorry but Turing seems to be outdated and should not be seriously entertained as a reliable measure of Artificial Intelligence.

That would solve our problem of not making our AI "too smart" to pass this test- however I have doubts about how we would be able to inject a lifetime of memory into an already functioning brain.  I am sure that the growth of the human brain is dependent on memory as it comes in, so that if we reverse engineer the human brain, and program our own, we couldn't just inject an adult's memory into it (that would cause for a massive headache), seeing as we respond to information as it streams in.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Just a couple of quick observations:
<br>
<br>
The capacity to do a brain scan that will allow reverse engineering a specific brain will not be available for at least a few decades, if not centuries. Let's say it is somehow enough to just extract the physical organization of the neurons in a live brain (which is obviously insufficient - we need to know the chemistry at each synapse as well), we will need to obtain a scan at a resolution of 0.1 micron or better. If we scan a cube of 100x100x100mm, this translates into 10 to the 18th power data (giga giga) points! The scan needs to be obtained at a very short time (say 1 microsec) to guarantee that nothing moved more than 0.1 micron during the scan.
<br>
Even if the electronics and computation means to collect and process data at the required resolution and time period would become available in the next 30 years, the physics for doing such a thing are currently completely unknown. CT and MRI scanners can do no better than 0.5mm resolution (about 10 to the 8th power points) over tens of milliseconds, and this has improved very gradually over the last 30 years. No other approach to high resolution 3D scans of a live brain is even on the horizon. I just don't see how improvements of 10 orders of magnitude in resolution and 6 orders of magnitude in time will be achieved in this time frame.
<br>
<br>
So - forget about brain scans and reverse engineering by 2029.
<br>
<br>
Another observation is that whatever artificial intelligence system is developed by that date, it will have to undergo a substantial period of learning before it can succeed in passing the test. If the learning will be self-learning (ie, experiential), it will take quite a few years fpr the system to acquire the full scale of an adult human world and common-sense knowledge. Alternatively, if the knowledge will be "downloaded" to it, human experiential knowledge will have to be manually translated into a binary code for the download. This will also take a long period, especially since it will need to be extensively tested and debugged to ensure entry errors are caught and corrected. For example, to answer the question "What would you do if I dropped a X on your foot?" for all possible nouns X (eg, muffin, lead pipe, knife, nephew) the system will have to be correctly aware of the combination of properties of typical samples of thousands of nouns. Somebody will have to manually put that information in the system.
<br>
<br>
This brings me to my last observation: even if such an incredibly complex and knowledgable piece of software would be incrementally developed by 2029, it will take many years to find and correct enough bugs to allow it to run for two or more hours of a completely unconstrained conversational test without screwing up royally at least once , eg,
<br>
Q: "What would you feel if I threw you in the sewer?"
<br>
A: "I'm unable to answer this question due to insufficient information. Please provide more details."
<br>
<br>
With all due respect to the exponential progress of some technologies, my conclusion is that 30 years are just not enough for sufficient progress to be made.

We already have that kind of precision. Too invasive for now.

<br>

<br>
That is not true. We need a lot less. It's not a random data inside brains, but neurons with a position and connections. I think it could be stored in 10^15 bytes or less. Some computers will soon have that amount of storage.
<br>
<br>
&gt; The scan needs to be obtained at a very short time (say 1 microsec) to guarantee that nothing moved more than 0.1 micron during the scan.
<br>

What if it moves? A LOT of neurons die every second - but the whole thinking process is not affected much.

Let him have enough time - thousand years! We could go for a short vacations (a week or two) meanwhile.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Somebody will have to manually put that information in the system.

Why? I don't understand why.

<br>
<br>
&gt; Not each. They are not that different. 
<br>
<br>
What I meant was: you need to know the "weight" of each synapse in contributing to the firing of the neuron to which it is connected. This varies a lot from synapse to synapse, and it is critical to know it to be able to reverse engineer a particular brain.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; this translates into 10 to the 18th power data (giga giga) points! 
<br>
<br>
&gt;That is not true. We need a lot less. It's not a random data inside brains, but neurons with a position and connections. I think it could be stored in 10^15 bytes or less. Some computers will soon have that amount of storage. 
<br>
<br>
You cannot know in advance what points to acquire, since you don't know where the dendrites and synapses are - that's what you are trying to find.
<br>
<br>
Storage of the data is not the issue, it is the need to extract an immense amount of 3D data all at once that's the problem.
<br>
<br>
I should add also that even if such a non-invasive samping device would have existed, we would still need to develop sophisticated algorithms for reliably automatically tracing the dendrites in the data and building the connectivity map. This will take a few more years as well.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The scan needs to be obtained at a very short time (say 1 microsec) to guarantee that nothing moved more than 0.1 micron during the scan. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;What if it moves? A LOT of neurons die every second - but the whole thinking process is not affected much. 
<br>
<br>
If it moves, the dentrites will become blurry in the 3D data and you will not be able to tell which two neurons they connect.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; No other approach to high resolution 3D scans of a live brain is even on the horizon. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;And will not be for decades? 
<br>
<br>
No one can say that, but it takes a decade or two, even today, for a fundamental discovery to be converted to practical, reliable, devices. And, as I said, no such fundamental discovery is currently on the horizon.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; it will have to undergo a substantial period of learning before it can succeed in passing the test 
<br>
<br>
&gt; 'Substantial period' for an upload could be 14 days for us - and 10 thousand years for him. This is the whole point of the Singularity. 
<br>
<br>
Experiential learning requires that the system will actually undergo real life experiences (eg, participate in social interactions with people, see what they do in the washroom). This cannot be compressed in time, although I can imagine, perhaps, many systems acquiring experiences in parallel and then sharing them somehow. Even then, fast sharing of experiences between huge neurological simulations will be a tough technological challenge that will take many years to figure out.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Somebody will have to manually put that information in the system. 
<br>
<br>
&gt; Why? I don't understand why. 
<br>
<br>
Before the system can make sense of what books say about human experience, it will have to know a lot of things about everyday life. Somebody will have to enter those things into the system (or, perhaps, cyc will help - see www.cyc.com - but I doubt that it will be possible to easily translate cyc to another storage format).

But then again - we uploaders are most likely correct in our optimism.
<br>
<br>
Take another approach!
<br>
<br>
A human inside NMRI is scanned. The data stream from his head to the computer has a certain value in bauds.
<br>
<br>
The going on changes inside the brains are another data stream.
<br>
<br>
If the first stream is bigger, than after some (long) time we have a picture not completely different of what is the real one.
<br>
<br>
This approach is currently exploited in the quest for the extra solar planets.
<br>
<br>
Some star is observed for a long time. Than the best possible explaining model is created. Showing a planet or two.
<br>
<br>
The data for an upload may already be scattered around.
<br>
<br>
At least - we have more data every day.

I bet my world view. If that will not be possible by 2029 - I will abandon my views.

This is what we do to measure adulthood in our children, why not use the same thing to measure human similarities in a machine?
<br>
I believe there will have to be an amount of chaos to its calculations to give it the ability to be loose and not always correct, and yet all this conversation about randomness, I never do anything at random...people are very sensually stimulated and usually always have personal gain motives involved in our decision making tasks.  Self preservation is a key element in human behavior...if you give a logical system this formula, it is liable to do away with anything that threatens it...Sort of like son of man evolutionism.  As far as the turing test, I feel it is possible to fool a human on paper, with a phoney story and a precision memory...unless the person issuing judgement is aware that this is highly likely a strong suite of a computer.  Maybe the question should have to do with an infinite number and take away the ability to round up...remember the old department store buffer overflow hack in trick.  I believe if you have the ability to give a machine 5 senses and base algorhythms around how it analyses and interacts with these "senses" that is more of a human like endeavor.  I also would like to reply on another subject that somebody printed...it was said that the computer with AI would be smart enough to trick the average human and would have to use fiction statements to do so...this means the machine for its own advancement has been taught to trick human intellect to be praised or accepted.  I believe that I find a machine that is cunning enough to trick a human on purpose for self gain is a scary idea...I don't even like human beings that use deception, let alone a machine that may see us as pollutant biological diseases that plague an earth.

PS: Humans are the only piece that really don't fit into the equation quite right.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I would strongly urge you to refrain from talking about subjects you know nothing about, as your post makes it quite clear that, like many who are interested in AI, you are woefully under-educated in the workings of the human brain.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; we need to know the chemistry at each synapse as well 
<br>
<br>
&gt;Not each. They are not that different. 
<br>
<br>
In fact, it is imperative to understand the exact chemistry of each synapse.  Part of the brain's immense complexity derives from the interactions of the various neurotransmitters with the numerous receptors that correspond to each one.
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; this translates into 10 to the 18th power data (giga giga) points! 
<br>
<br>
&gt;That is not true. We need a lot less. It's not a random data inside brains, but neurons with a position and connections. I think it could be stored in 10^15 bytes or less. Some computers will soon have that amount of storage. 
<br>
<br>
Just as far as the simple math is concerned, the brain contains 100 billion (10 to the 11th) neurons, and each neuron can synapse on over 1000 other neurons, giving over 100 trillion (10 to the 14th) interconections.  When you then consider that it is also important where on each neuron the synapse is located, the storage required becomes obscene.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; The scan needs to be obtained at a very short time (say 1 microsec) to guarantee that nothing moved more than 0.1 micron during the scan. 
<br>
<br>
&gt;What if it moves? A LOT of neurons die every second - but the whole thinking process is not affected much. 
<br>
<br>
That is complete and utter BS.  After childhood, neuron death almost never occurs without some kind of trauma to the nervous system, be it injury, toxicity, or lack of oxygen.  True, it is possible to destroy sonetimes very large quantities of neurons without hindering fuction, (example: destroying all of the sensory cortex on one side of the brain usually leads to no long term defecits), it is also possible to kill small quantities of neurons and create a huge change in thought processes. (example: destroying the amygdala in both brain hemispheres will produce major emotional changes)
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; it will have to undergo a substantial period of learning before it can succeed in passing the test 
<br>
<br>
&gt;'Substantial period' for an upload could be 14 days for us - and 10 thousand years for him. This is the whole point of the Singularity. 
<br>
<br>
Let's note confuse concepts from quantum physics seep in where they don't belong.  No matter what anyone may try to say, there is no way for an "intelligence" to obtain 10,000 years of experience in any less than 10,000 years.  (Neglecting the effects of einsteinian time dilation)

<br>
<br>
I agree with the "gist" of your comments, which I take to be that "fully mapping a human brain" is quite out of reach for the near term.
<br>
<br>
I am not entirely in agreement that such detail is required to "understand" how the brain operates (to whatever degree that understanding is useful to the development of AI, or even new substrates for "sentience".)
<br>
<br>
I agree that even small differences in the (momentary) chemical concentrations at synaptic junctions (for instance) contribute to what makes one person an individual in thought.
<br>
<br>
But take any two people at random, and they have no two "neurons" in precisely the same locations, nor precisely the same interneural "wiring", nor possess precisely the same chemical concentrations, and yet both people tend to stop at red lights, wait for the "walk" sign to cross a street, understand a common language, etc.
<br>
<br>
This suggests that a very great deal can be "abstracted" away from the uniqueness of individual brains, while retaining the structural features that serve to provide for intelligent interaction with the world.
<br>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The "broad" meaning of Turing test is non-sense.The aspiration of the broad meaning is that if computer is "completely" interchangeable in the communication then they could also be constructed (they could) to behave the same way as a human and that they could have the same (or perhaps even more intelligent) impact (or at least judgement) to its neighboorhood as humans. This is the BROAD sense in my point of view as anything less is still "narrow", limited to some sort of test restrictions. They could not. I can never love a robot no matter how intelligent he seems to be.
<br>
<br>
In fact Turing test is just an abstract intellectual scheme which fits some pre-arranged environment and human life cannot be reduced to ANY fixed environment. Take a human into a new environment and a man shall find a new solutions of new problems. Take a learned computer into a new environment and in the best he shall derive something from his past knowledge base. In many cases the derivatives shall be completely different from the human solution and one shall easily discover that the opposite IS A MACHINE.
<br>

Machines may only imitate human intelligence but they need to be feeded with the current status of the results of human understanding of the reality and of the environment. Machines whose behaviour (or just judgment to stay with Turing) is indistinguishable (in the short term) from the humans are human dependent in the long term but this dependency allows to distinguish them from the human really.
<br>
<br>
(In some sense even the poeple are "interdependent" to exchange the information, one human culture may find different solutions to similar problems if the the groups are separated. Thus one easily recognizes that the opposite is from another culture as the customs of his behaviour are different. But "machines on their own" would be easily recognizable as out of all human cultures I believe.)

There are many mistakes in the assumptions of the broad Turing test. As mentioned the first is time, the second is the concentration to an individual body. But the human life is not only the life (and the intelligence) of the individual but of a community and of generations. Human ancestors tend to fix the mistakes of the predcessors. Not because that they are more intelligent beeings but because they discover that the teachings of their predcessors do not fit the new environment, the new findings, the new organization of the society etc.
<br>
<br>
Human history is full of effort to find the finite set of rules, the finite knowledge, the recipe for successfull and happy life. It did not work. We have found just some guidelines which must be re-interpreted by the living man again and again. 
<br>
<br>
Other mistakes in the broad Turing test are that "telecommunication" is limited only to a rational symbolic way of the communication. Humans communicate a lot by non-verbal means and even the words often have another hidden meaning according to some quite complex context (the context may be irrational too). Thus even robot fitting Turing test is still far away of communicating the same way as a human.
<br>
<br>
If I have to limit myself in the communication with the computer (e.g. I cannot even express my feelings in a full way and see at least the "rational part" of the reaction ) this means that I am significantly restricted in my human abilities. It is simply stupid to try to compare computer with a man with such limited conditions in the test which purpose is to prove that computer is equal to man.
<br>
<br>
Creating any other sort of machine intelligence (e.g. adaptive replication) which could manufacture itself and exist independently from poeple but be clearly distinguishable from them, for good or for bad, is different story then the Turing test.
<br>
<br>
Thus there is nothing to win. One cannot win in the discipline which is poorly defined. You may win only by narrowing the conditions.</p></td>
