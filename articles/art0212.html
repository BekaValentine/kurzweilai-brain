<div class="TeaserText">The androids and other intelligent machines in "A.I." represent well-grounded science futurism, says AI pioneer Raymond Kurzweil.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published June 18, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kubrick_entry.html">Stanley Kubrick</a> developed his ideas for a movie to be called "A.I." for over ten years, passing the baton to <a class="thought" href="entries/spielberg_entry.html">Steven Spielberg</a> upon his untimely <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>.  As was his working style, Kubrick did not write a screenplay, but kept copious notebooks of ideas.  The task of carrying Kubrick's conception to fruition presented Spielberg with a singular opportunity, but also unique challenges, the most obvious being how to meld Kubrick's dark visions with his own affirming perspective.  </p>
<p>Both filmmakers capture the intricate dualities of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, but Kubrick tends to wallow in the enigmatic crevices of humankind's ardors, from Strangelovian underground sanctuaries to, well, cybernetic psychosis.  While Kubrick is likely to reveal the madness that lurks beneath a fa&#231;ade of normalcy, Spielberg's capacity is to show us the humanity that survives <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> madness.  Even in Schindler's List, we are continually able to gain a measure of comfort from the passionate portrayal of one man's exercise of heroism that carries us through to the last moving scene.</p>
<p>So one question I had going into the advance screening of "A.I." was whether we would hear both voices, whether this remarkable and unusual collaboration would preserve the seemingly disparate outlooks of two legendary artists.</p>
<p>My other <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> question was whether this portrayal of a world of "strong" <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> would reflect what I would regard as well-grounded <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> futurism, or if it would devolve to the usual facile <a class="thought" href="entries/dystopian_entry.html">dystopian</a>ism or sentimental <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a>ism.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that the movie succeeds in both of these key dimensions.  Spielberg fans will certainly be pleased with the beautiful cinematography, imaginative effects, and the continual surprises of the story line.  We see allusions to many former Spielberg movies from the story of the intelligent but not altogether <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> hero's desire to call (and to go) home to the "Close Encounters"-like portrayal of the far-into-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>s.</p>
<p>But putting on my hat as Kubrick fan, I was also quite satisfied as we encounter Clockwork Orange-like dreamscapes and Kubrick's vintage brooding colors.  As in 2001, the most <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> characters are the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, with the sole exception of David's "adopted" mother.</p>
<p>In A.I., the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s are neither evil nor particularly destructive.  Indeed our sympathies are usually with them, at least mine were.  It's the humans who express the base <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s of destructive jealousy as they taunt and ultimately destroy the stray <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>s in the Coliseum-like spectacle of the "Flesh Fair."  Here Spielberg has the opportunity to present the key issues of the movie and, indeed, of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  Are the independent robots who rummage through junk yards <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing for usable spare parts to enhance their lot a threat to humanity?  Are they becoming "too smart, too many, too fast," as their <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> tormentors claim?</p>
<p>Spielberg makes the point that it's not the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-like quality of the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that is threatening, as we have become quite comfortable with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>-like <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.  It's the potential for amplifying our <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> that is the most menacing, at least those aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> displayed by many of the humans in the film: the cruelty of the purveyor of the Flesh Fair, the betrayal by the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> who frames the Gigolo Joe <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a> for murder, and the greed of the William Hurt character who creates David but attempts to rob him of his individuality.</p>
<p>The Flesh Fair scene also presents the important issue of cruelty to <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.  In my lectures I often point out that we don't worry much today about causing pain and suffering to our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, a line which is usually good for a few laughs (at least for an after-dinner audience).  Spielberg applies the power of the cinema to show us just how compelling an issue this will actually become.</p>
<p>We meet three generations of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s in the movie, with the last generation far in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.  Even the first generation we meet is sufficiently <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>, in the positive <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of the term, to fear their capture and to help protect each other from the angry prejudices of threatened and threatening "real" humans.</p>
<p>David is presented as a more advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>, one that has the capacity to learn to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>.  David will become a "real boy" when he becomes capable of this higher <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>.  I'd have to say that this matches my own perspective, that we will come to accept <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities as "<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>" when they are capable of understanding and expressing our most subtle <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s.</p>
<p>What do <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s have to do with <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>?  In my view, our <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>al capacity represents the most intelligent thing we do.  It's the cutting edge of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>, and as the film portrays, it will be the last exclusive province of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> humanity, one that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will ultimately master as well.  By the way, if David wishing to become "a real boy" sounds like a familiar fairy tale, the movie makes the allusion and metaphor of Pinocchio explicit.  Even early in his development, David is sufficiently appealing that he wins the sympathies of the Flesh Fair spectators, much to the dismay of the master of ceremonies, who implores the audience to "not be fooled by the talent of this artistry."</p>
<p>In the third conception of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that the movie presents, we see entities that are supremely sublime.  I've always maintained that we will ultimately change our notion of what it is to be a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.  We now regard a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> as something profoundly inferior to a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>.  But that's only because all the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s we've encountered are still a million times simpler than ourselves.  But that gap is shrinking at an exponential rate, and the movie examines what I believe will be the last frontier: mastering our most noble <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s, a capability displayed by only one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in the movie and sought by at least one <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>.  I won't give away the movie's ending by revealing whether David is successful in his quest, but I will say that at one point he does display a decidedly inhuman degree of patience.</p>
<p>It was also my feeling that the very advanced entities we meet later in the movie are displaying a noble character that is <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-affirming in the Spielbergian <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>.  I have also maintained that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s will appreciate that they are derivative of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a>, and will thereby revere their <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> ancestors.  This view is supported in Spielberg's conception of the most advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that we meet in the film.</p>
<p>David seeks to learn to <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to be acceptable to his mother.  But the film is neither maudlin nor predictable, since it takes many unexpected turns not only in the plot line but in our understanding of the parameters of David's world.  This allows Spielberg to display his playful imagination, which I'm sure kept many graphics scientists busy creating the inventive effects.  In the movie's sole exploration of <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>, we meet Dr. Know, a hyperactive Einstein-like holographic projection who seeks to guide David and his intelligent stuffed bear, both of whom have since teamed up with Gigolo Joe.</p>
<p>At first, Dr. Know seems too literal, as if he were a contemporary <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a>, but we ultimately discover that Dr. Know does understand David's plight and gives him some critical hints.  The interaction with Dr. Know also illustrates another keen insight about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, that the only thing of value is <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>The movie accurately portrays erotic applications as at least one vital driving force pushing the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> forward.  As Gigolo Joe points out to one of his clients, "Once you've had <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> with Mecca, you'll never want a 'real' man again."  Mecca, as in "mechanical," is the movie's clever designation for <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.  One gets the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> that it was the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s in the movie who came up with this label.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> used and the depiction of the sexual situations should be comfortable for parents and their young teenage children, in keeping with the PG-13 rating that a film such as this must have.  Discussions on <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> lists indicate there was some struggle with the film rating board about the rating. Could it be that like the anxious humans in the movie, the members of the rating board find the very idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/sex_entry.html">sex</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to be unduly provocative?</p>
<p>Is this <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> futurism or idle <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> fantasy?  I believe that the <a class="thought" href="entries/android_entry.html">android</a>s and other intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that we meet in the movie, although imaginative, do represent well-grounded <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> futurism.  We will indeed meet <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> entities with the range of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that we encounter in "A.I."  We already have hundreds of contemporary examples of  "narrow" <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, that is, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that can perform well defined tasks that we regard as examples of intelligent behavior when performed by humans, ranging from diagnosing blood cells and electrocardiograms, guiding cruise missiles, solving mathematical theorems, playing master-level games, making financial investment decisions, and many others.</p>
<p>It is true that <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s today do not yet have the subtlety or range of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that humans display.  However, within thirty years, we will have completed the scanning and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> and will be able to instantiate the templates of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that we discover through this endeavor in <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>s.  Some of the "strong" <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>'s that result will be manifest in <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-appearing robots such as those we meet in the movie, while others will take other forms.</p>
<p>One could certainly nit-pick anyone's detailed imagining of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.  For example, in my conception, we'll have images written directly to our <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s so we won't need flat panel displays, let alone paper books; roads won't need visible markers; and <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s won't be etched on printed <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> boards.  The <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> will, in my view, include more <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> and more embedded <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in everyday objects.</p>
<p>But on the important questions, I feel that Spielberg, armed with Kubrick's decade of notes, got it right, particularly in the idea of the mastery of our higher <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s as the defining challenge of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, and the ultimate definition of humanness.</p>

Ray talks about the reverse engineering of the brain being done in 20 years.
<br>
<br>
Without accelerating change, this would seem impossible, but the pace is speeding, and Henry Markram's project will be reporting in summer 2008 on IBM bluebrain which is attempting to map the brain....though it's a long way off completion... and Henry looks increasing like Vlad the Impaler.
