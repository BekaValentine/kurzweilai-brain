<div class="TeaserText">There are very few diseases or conditions--including infectious diseases--aside from physical brain damage, that cannot be cured using nanomedicine, says nanomedicine pioneer Robert A. Freitas Jr. He believes nanomedicine's greatest power will emerge in a decade or two as we learn to design and construct complete artificial nanorobots using diamondoid nanometer-scale parts and subsystems.</div>

              from Interview with Robert Freitas: Part 1</a>.</i></p>
<p>Robert A. Freitas Jr., J.D., published the first detailed technical 
              design study of a mechanical nanorobot ever published in a peer-reviewed 
              mainstream biomedical journal and is the author of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">nanomedicine</a>, 
              the first book-length technical discussion of the medical applications 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and medical nanorobotics.</p>
<h3>Question 1: How far can simple genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering go towards 
              curing <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s? Does pre-nanotechnology based <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> have the 
              potential to cure <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and regrow organs?</h3>
<p>

  Yes, of course. Genetic
engineering is a very powerful technology. Pre-nanotechnology treatments for some forms of cancer already
exist. The emerging discipline of
tissue engineering is already heading in the direction of building tissues and
organs using special scaffolds that are impregnated with appropriate cells
which grow into the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> to form cohesive new tissues. Single-organ cloning is also on the
horizon. But all of these treatments
and organ substitutions could be accomplished with greater reliability, executed
with greater speed, and completed in a side-effect free manner, using the tools
of nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. There are also
many kinds of treatments, particularly those related to physical trauma, that
can only be dealt with efficiently using advanced nanorobotic medicine.

<p>
   The way I like to think about all this is to recognize that
&#8220;nanomedicine&#8221; is most simply and generally defined as the preservation and
improvement of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health, using molecular tools and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of
the human body. Nanomedicine involves
the use of three <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual classes of molecularly precise <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s: <a class="thought" href="entries/nonbiological_entry.html">nonbiological</a> nanomaterials and
nanoparticles, <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>-based materials and <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, and nonbiological
devices including nanorobotics.
<p>

In the near term, say, the next 5 years, the molecular tools
of nanomedicine will include <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>ly active materials with well-defined
nanoscale structures, including those produced by the <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s of genetic
engineering. For example, one of the
first uses of &#8220;nanotechnology&#8221; in treating cancer employs engineered
nanoparticles of various kinds to attempt a general cure while staying within
the usual drug-treatment <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>. Kopelman&#8217;s group at the University of Michigan has developed dye-tagged
nanoparticles that can be inserted into living cells as biosensors. This quickly led to nanomaterials
incorporating a variety of plug-in modules, creating molecular nanodevices for
the early detection and therapy of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cancer. One type of <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> is attached to a cancer <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/antibody_entry.html">antibody</a> that
adheres to cancer cells, and is also affixed with a contrast <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> to make the
particle highly visible during <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a>, while also enhancing the selective
cancer-killing effect during subsequent <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> irradiation of the treated brain
tissue.


<p>

Another example from the University of Michigan is the
dendrimers, tree-shaped synthetic <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s with a regular branching structure
emanating outward from a core. The
outermost layer can be functionalized with other useful molecules such as
genetic therapy agents, decoys for viruses, or anti-HIV agents. The next step<b> </b>is to create dendrimer
cluster agents,<b> </b>multi-<a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> nanodevices<b> </b>called
tecto-dendrimers<b> </b>built up from a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a><b> </b>of single-dendrimer
modules.<b> </b>These modules perform
specialized functions<b> </b>such as<b> </b>diseased cell recognition,<b> </b>diagnosis
of disease state,<b> </b>therapeutic drug delivery,<b> </b>location reporting,<b>
</b>and therapy outcome reporting.<b> </b>The
framework can be customized<b> </b>to fight a particular cancer<b> </b>simply
by substituting<b> </b>any one of many possible<b> </b>distinct cancer recognition<b>
</b>or &#8220;targeting&#8221; dendrimers. The
larger trend in medical nanomaterials is to migrate from single-function
molecules to multi-module entities that can do many things, but only at certain
times or under certain conditions &#8211; exemplifying a continuing, and, in my view,
inevitable, technological <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> toward a device-oriented nanomedicine.
            <p> In the mid-term, the next 5 or 10 years or so, knowledge gained from <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> 
              and proteomics will make possible new treatments tailored to specific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s, new drugs targeting <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s whose <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s have now 
              been decoded, and <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> treatments to repair damaged tissue, 
              replace missing function, or slow aging. We will see genetic therapies 
              and tissue engineering, and many other offshoots of biotechnology, 
              becoming more common in medical practice. We should also see artificial 
              organic devices that incorporate biological motors or self-assembled 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>-based structures for a variety of useful medical purposes. And 
              we&#8217;ll also see biological robots, derived from <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> or other 
              motile cells, that have had their genomes re-engineered and re-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med. 
            <p>
So yes, there is a lot that pre-nanotechnology, or, more
properly, pre-nanorobotic medicine can do to improve human health. But the advent of medical nanorobotics will
represent a huge leap forward.


            <h3>Question 2: Are there any diseases that can't be cured by nanotechnology? 
              Are there any aspects of aging that can't be stopped by nanotechnology?</h3>
<p> If we combine the benefits of a human <a class="thought" href="entries/physiology_entry.html">physiology</a> maintained at 
              the level of effectiveness possessed by our bodies when we were 
              children (e.g., <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/DeathIsAnOutrage.htm#Slide69" target="_blank">dechronification</a>), 
              along with the ability to deal with almost any form of severe trauma 
              (via nanosurgery), then there are very few diseases or conditions 
              that cannot be cured using nanomedicine. The only major class of 
              incurable illness which nanorobots can&#8217;t handle is the case of brain 
              damage in which portions of&#160;your brain have been physically 
              destroyed. This condition might not be reversible if unique <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              has been irrevocably lost (say, because you neglected to make a 
              backup copy of this information). There are several other minor 
              &#8220;incurable&#8221; conditions, but all of these similarly relate to the 
              loss of unique information. 
            <h3>Question 3: The Foresight community has deemphasized molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s in favor of a desktop manufacturing paradigm. How will 
              medical nanorobots be constructed?</h3>
<p> As noted in the previous interview, my view is that this change 
              of emphasis is unlikely to affect the conduct of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in the 
              field, or the activities of those few of us who are actually doing 
              the research involved, because the distinction between &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm" target="_blank">molecular 
              assemblers</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/5.9.4.htm" target="_blank">nanofactories</a>&#8221; 
              is largely cosmetic and because both approaches require almost exactly 
              the same <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of enabling technologies. At present we&#8217;re concentrating 
              our efforts mostly on developing these component enabling technologies, 
              not on integration of these technologies into larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/6.4.6.htm" target="_blank">Systems 
              analysis</a> will come next. 
            <p> Medical nanorobots small enough to go into the human bloodstream 
              will be very complex <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.&#160; We don&#8217;t know exactly how to 
              build them yet, but the overall pathway from here to there is slowly 
              starting to come into focus.&#160; Building and deploying nanorobotic 
              systems will require first the ability to build diamondoid structures 
              to molecular precision, using atomic force microscopy or similar 
              means along with the techniques of diamond mechanosynthesis. My 
              early work on diamond mechanosynthesis is described in a lecture 
              I gave at the 2004 Foresight Conference in Washington DC, the text 
              of which (plus many images) is available <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/PathDiamMolMfg.htm" target="_blank">online</a>. 
              I&#8217;m currently involved in 6 collaborations with university groups 
              in the U.S, U.K. and Russia (including both theoretical and <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al 
              efforts) to push forward the technology in this area, and I have 
              several new papers nearing completion for journal submission very 
              soon on this work. 
            <p> This must be followed by developing the ability to design and 
              manufacture rigid machine parts and then to assemble them into larger 
              machine systems, up to and including nanorobots. My forthcoming 
              book with Josh Hall (<i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.rfreitas.com/index.htm#Machines" target="_blank">Fundamentals 
              of Nanomechanical Engineering</a></i>) and the development of the 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/" target="_blank">NanoEngineer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanorex.com/" target="_blank">Nanorex</a> should advance our 
              ability to design nanomechanical components, and further simulations 
              and experiments will be required to learn how to build these systems 
              and then assemble them into larger structures. 
            <p> Once <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/PathDiamMolMfg.htm" target="_blank">diamond 
              mechanosynthesis</a> and the fabrication of nanoparts becomes feasible, 
              we will also need a massively parallel manufacturing capability 
              to assemble nanorobots cheaply, precisely, and in vast quantities. 
              My recently published technical book, co-authored with Merkle and 
              titled <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM.htm" target="_blank">Kinematic 
              Self-Replicating Machines</a></i> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.landesbioscience.com/" target="_blank">Landes 
              Bioscience</a>, 2004), surveys all known current work in the field 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> and replicative manufacturing, including concepts 
              of molecular assemblers and nanofactories. (This book is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM.htm" target="_blank">freely 
              available online</a> at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/" target="_blank">Molecular 
              Assembler website</a>.) 
            <p> Finally, the reliable mass-production of medical nanorobots must 
              be followed by a period of testing and approval for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank">biocompatibility</a> 
              and safety by the FDA or its equivalent in other countries. I would 
              not be surprised if the first deployment of such systems occurred 
              during the 2020s.&#160; But until we can build these devices experimentally, 
              we are limited to theoretical analyses and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> 
              simulations (some of which are now so good that their accuracy rivals 
              the results of actual experiments). 
            <p> So we can take two approaches, both of which I&#8217;m pursuing.&#160; 
              First, we can use our knowledge of the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and the principles 
              of good engineering to create exemplar designs of nanorobots, and 
              to analyze potential capabilities and uses of these devices, and 
              determine which applications are likely to be possible and which 
              seem not to be feasible.&#160; This helps to establish a clear long-term 
              goal.&#160; Second, we can examine the <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation pathways that 
              could lead from where we are today to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when we may 
              be able to build nanorobotic devices.&#160; As noted above, this 
              may require <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/PathDiamMolMfg.htm" target="_blank">diamond 
              mechanosynthesis</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/5.7.htm" target="_blank">massively 
              parallel nanofabrication</a> capabilities.&#160; Earlier this year 
              I submitted the first-ever <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/DMSToolbuildProvPat.htm" target="_blank">U.S. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a> on diamond mechanosynthesis</a> that describes one possible 
              specific experimental process for achieving molecularly precise 
              diamond structures in a practical way. 
            <h3>Question 4: How will nanorobots avoid being destroyed by our immune 
              systems? Won't our <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>s identify them as foreign <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s 
              and immediately attack them?</h3>
<p> Nanorobots constructed of diamondoid materials cannot be destroyed 
              by our immune system. They can be made to be essentially <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/9.3.5.3.6.htm" target="_blank">impervious 
              to chemical attack</a>. However, the body may react to their presence 
              in a way that may interfere with their function. This raises the 
              issue of nanorobot biocompatibility. 
            <p> The biocompatibility of medical nanorobots is a complex and <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant 
              issue. That&#8217;s why I expanded my original discussion in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a> 
              book series from a single chapter (Chapter 15, <i>Nanomedicine Vol.

              issues related to nanorobots in the brain, with special attention 
              to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA/15.3.6.5.htm#p8" target="_blank">blood-brain 
              barrier</a>. 
            <p> The key issue for enabling full-immersion reality is obtaining 
              the necessary <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> inside the body, which should be available 
              using the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/7.3.1.htm" target="_blank">in 
              vivo<span style="font-style:normal"> fiber network</span></a></i> I first proposed in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm" target="_blank">Nanomedicine, Vol. 
              I</a> (1999). Such a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> can handle 10<sup>18</sup> bits/sec 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> traffic, capacious enough for real-time brain-state monitoring. 
              The fiber network has a 30 cm<sup>3</sup> volume and generates 4-6 
              watts waste heat, both small enough for safe installation in a 1400 
              cm<sup>3</sup> 25-watt human brain. Signals travel at most a few 
              meters at nearly the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, so transit time from signal 
              origination at neuron sites inside the brain to the external <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              system mediating the upload are ~0.00001 millisec which is considerably 
              less than the minimum ~5 millisec neuron discharge cycle time. Neuron-monitoring 
              chemical sensors located on average ~2 microns apart can capture 
              relevant chemical events occurring within a ~5 millisec time window, 
              since this is the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/Tables/3.4.jpg" target="_blank">approximate 
              diffusion time</a> for, say, a small neuropeptide across a 2-micron 
              distance. Thus human brain state monitoring can probably be &#8220;instantaneous,&#8221; 
              at least on the timescale of human neural response, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              of &#8220;nothing of significance was missed.&#8221; 
            <p> I believe Ray was relying upon these earlier analyses, among others, 
              when making his proposals. 
            <h3>Question 6: What is your best guess regarding the development 
              of advanced medical nanotechnology? Will it appear within a decade 
              of the first desktop assembler?</h3>
<p> The availability of practical molecular manufacturing is an obvious 
              and necessary precursor to the widespread use of medical nanorobotics. I would not be surprised if the 2020&#8217;s are eventually dubbed 
              the &#8220;Decade of Medical Nanorobots.&#8221; 
            <h3>Question 7: Will nanorobots be able to eradicate all infectious 
              disease? After all, bacteria and viruses are extremely adaptable, 
              and have developed a plethora of effective techniques to thwart 
              the immune system.</h3>
<p> It will probably not be possible to eradicate all infectious disease. 
              The current bacterial population of <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> may be ~10<sup>31</sup> 
              organisms and so the chances are good that most of them are going 
              to survive in some host reservoir, somewhere on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, for 
              as long as <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> exists here, despite our best efforts to eradicate 
              them. However, it should be possible to eliminate all harmful effects, 
              and all harmful natural disease organisms, from the human body, 
              allowing us to lead lives that are free of pathogen-mediated illness 
              (at least most of the time). A simple antimicrobial nanorobot like 
              the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.jetpress.org/volume14/freitas.html" target="_blank">microbivore</a> 
              should be able to eliminate even the most severe bloodborne infections 
              in treatment times on the order of an hour; more sophisticated devices 
              could be used to tackle more difficult infection scenarios. 
            <p> Regarding microbial adaptability, it makes no difference if a 
              bacterium has acquired multiple drug resistance to <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s or 
              to any other traditional treatment &#8211; the microbivore will eat it 
              anyway, achieving complete clearance of even the most severe septicemic 
              infections in minutes to hours, as compared to weeks or even months 
              for antibiotic-assisted natural phagocytic defenses, without increasing 
              the risk of sepsis or septic shock. Hence microbivores, each 2-3 microns in size, appear to be 
              up to ~1000 times faster-acting than either unaided natural or antibiotic-assisted 
              biological phagocytic defenses, and can extend the doctor&#8217;s reach 
              to the entire range of potential bacterial threats, including locally 
              dense infections. 
            <h3>Question 8: Have you made any detailed, molecularly precise simulations 
              of medical nanorobots?</h3>
<p> The greatest power of nanomedicine will emerge in a decade or 
              two as we learn to design and construct complete artificial nanorobots 
              using diamondoid nanometer-scale parts and subsystems including 
              sensors, motors, manipulators, power plants, and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecular_computer_entry.html">molecular computer</a>s. The development pathway will be lengthy and difficult. First, theoretical scaling studies must be used to assess 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> concept feasibility. These 
              initial studies would then be followed by more detailed computational 
              simulations of specific nanorobot components and assemblies, and 
              ultimately full systems simulations, all thoroughly integrated with 
              additional simulations of massively parallel manufacturing processes 
              from start to finish consistent with a design-for-assembly engineering 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>. Once molecular 
              manufacturing capabilities become available, experimental efforts 
              may <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> from component fabrication and testing, to component 
              assembly, and finally to prototypes and mass manufacture, ultimately 
              leading to clinical trials. 
            <p> As of 2005, progress in medical nanorobotics remains largely at 
              the concept feasibility stage &#8211; since 1998, the author has published 
              four theoretical nanorobot scaling studies, including the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html" target="_blank">respirocytes</a> 
              (artificial red cells), <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.jetpress.org/volume14/freitas.html" target="_blank">microbivores</a> 
              (artificial white cells), <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.imm.org/Reports/Rep018.html" target="_blank">clottocytes</a> 
              (artificial platelets), and the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.jetpress.org/volume11/vasculoid.html" target="_blank">vasculoid</a> 
              (an artificial vascular system). These studies have not been intended 
              to yield an actual engineering design for a future nanomedical product. 
              Rather, the purpose was merely to examine a set of appropriate design 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s, scaling issues, and reference designs to assess whether 
              or not the core idea might be feasible, and to determine key limitations 
              of such designs. 
            <p> The basic diamondoid structure of the respirocyte, the simplest 
              nanorobot designed to date, includes 18 billion atoms. Molecular 
              mechanics simulations of systems including 10-40 billion atoms have 
              recently been reported using cluster <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s. So it is now 
              possible, at least in principle, to attempt a basic simulation of 
              an entire working medical nanorobot. The problems with actually 
              doing this are many, and include the lack of a detailed atomic-level 
              description of the respirocyte, a lack of reliable nanopart designs 
              for components comprising the respirocyte, the difficulties of preparing 
              input files and running massive simulations, and <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to the personnel 
              and computer time necessary to run the simulation. Such a simulation 
              might well be attempted sometime in the next 5-10 years. Meanwhile 
              we must <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> ourselves with molecular mechanics simulations of 
              molecularly precise nanocomponents, starting with structures of 
              up to 100,000 atoms using, for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the new <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/" target="_blank">NanoEngineer</a>

            <h3><b>Question 9: How has the mainstream medical community reacted 
              to your research?</b></h3>
<p> I think the biggest impact so far has been in solidifying the 
              long-term vision of where the technology can go. Typically articles 
              describing future medicine, especially nanotechnology-based medicine, 
              will lead off with a mention of &#8220;nanorobots in the bloodstream&#8221; 
              as an idea that lies out there somewhere in the distant future, 
              before moving on to a more substantive discussion of the latest 
              news in medical nanoparticle research. This is entirely understandable 
              and logical. Doctors are faced with the immediacy of sick or dying 
              patients, and can only employ the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s at their command today. 
              Realistically, there will only be some small fraction of the traditional 
              medical community that &#8220;gets it&#8221; right off the bat. The intended 
              audience of my <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> book 
              series is technical and professional people who are seriously interested 
              in the future of medical technology. Many practicing physicians 
              do not &#8211; and quite correctly should not &#8211; fit this description. 
              But I know I&#8217;m having an impact. I&#8217;ve received dozens of emails 
              from students and young researchers thanking me for inspiring them 
              to consider new career directions. (I&#8217;ve also been told, only partly 
              tongue-in-cheek, that my <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> 
              books are often used by postdocs to help prepare their grant proposals 
              because of all the relevant literature references collected in each 
              volume.) 
            <p> As medical nanorobotics proceeds along the development pathway 
              I&#8217;ve outlined above &#8211; moving from drawing board, to computer simulation, 
              to laboratory demonstration of mechanosynthesis, to component design 
              and fabrication, to parts assembly and integration, and finally 
              to device performance and safety testing &#8211; members of the mainstream 
              medical community will naturally pay increasing attention to it, 
              because it will become more directly relevant to them. By mid-century, 
              medical nanorobotics will completely dominate medical practice. 
              By writing the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> book 
              series, <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM.htm" target="_blank">KSRM</a></i>, 
              and the rest, I hope to accelerate the process of technological 
              development and adoption of nanorobotics in modern medicine. To 
              this end, the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> 
              book series and my other books are being made freely available online, 
              with the generous consent of my publisher, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.landesbioscience.com/" target="_blank">Landes 
              Bioscience</a>. Such generosity is still almost unheard of among 
              conventional book publishers. The main <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> we&#8217;re doing this is 
              to promote a broader discussion of the technical issues and a rapid 
              assessment of the possibilities by the worldwide biomedical and 
              engineering community. 
            <h3><b>Question 10: How far along are you in writing your Nanomedicine 
              book series? What else have you been up to lately, in the nanomedicine 
              area?</b></h3>
<p> I&#8217;ve been writing the <i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a></i> book 
              series since 1994. It was originally conceived as a single book, 
              then became a trilogy until I realized I needed an entire volume 
              devoted solely to biocompatibility, whereupon it became a tetralogy. 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI.htm" target="_blank">Volume

              Bioscience</a> in 1999 and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIA.htm" target="_blank">Volume

              I&#8217;m still writing the last 2 volumes (<i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMIIB.htm" target="_blank">NMIIB</a></i>,

              of this book series, an ongoing effort that&#160;will continue during 
              2005-2010. Earlier this year I published two reviews on the current 
              status of nanomedicine, available online at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/Papers/WhatIsNMMar05.pdf" target="_blank">http://<a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.nanomedicine.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>/Papers/WhatIsNMMar05.pdf</a> 
              and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/Papers/NMRevMar05.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nanomedicine.com/Papers/NMRevMar05.pdf</a>. 
              The first of these papers was the leadoff article for the premier 
              issue of the new journal <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/product.jsp?isbn=15499634" target="_blank">Nanomedicine</a> 
              (the first journal exclusively devoted to this field, published 
              by Elsevier), on whose <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/703416/editorialboard" target="_blank">Editorial 
              Board</a> I also serve. 
            <p> In a recent major collaborative effort, artist <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanogirl.com/index2.html" target="_blank">Gina Miller</a> has 
              finished work on a 3-minute long <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanogirl.com/museumfuture/dermaldisplay.htm" target="_blank">animation</a> 
              that nicely illustrates the workings of my proposed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.nanomedicine.com/NMI/7.4.6.7.htm#p3" target="_blank">programmable 
              dermal display</a> (essentially, a video-touchscreen nano-tattoo 
              that reports real-time medical information to the user, as reported 
              back by numerous nanorobots stationed in various locations inside 
              the body). I think this is a very cool animation. And of course 
              you can always visit my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081030023832/http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Gallery/index.html" target="_blank">Nanomedicine
