<h2>Puzzling Over <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">Progress</a> </h2>
<p>Suppose you had recently returned to <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> after three years 
              cast away on some mythical undiscovered island. Having sold your 
              story to a studio with their eye on Tom Hanks, you had <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and 
              money to sit back and read about the developments of the last three 
              or so years. If you started with a business focus, you would quickly 
              get a downbeat feeling as you read headlines and stories peppered 
              with phrases like "downsizing", "recession", "deflation fears", 
              "bankruptcies at record highs", "after the bubble burst", "postponing 
              retirement". Reading all this gloomy news, you might yearn for a 
              return to your unknown island.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">Switch</a> tracks. </p>
<p>Suppose that you ignored the business and economic headlines spanning 
              your absence from 2000 to 2003. After struggling to erect a simple 
              shelter from what you remembered from <i><a class="thought" href="entries/robinson_entry.html">Robinson</a> Crusoe</i>, you're 
              more interested in how technologies have advanced in those few years. 
              You ask for a big pile of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on what's been happening in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> over the last few years. Oh, and throw in any new projections 
              of what's just ahead.</p>
<p>You chuckle at the pictures of Roomba, the saucer-shaped carpet-sweeping 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> from iRobot. Someone has finally made some kind of useful 
              household robot. Honda's Asimo is still clumsy, but is a surprising 
              jump ahead, and you see too many new versions of <a class="thought" href="entries/sony_entry.html">Sony</a>'s Aibo robopet 
              to keep track of them all. Turning on the tablet <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> someone lent 
              you (nice toy!), you can't help jotting down some of the advanced 
              gadgets you're reading about. High resolution yet small <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              cameras, cellphones with built-in <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> players or cameras, the 
              Segway <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> Transporter, and large plasma displays for remarkable 
              prices. Wait, you must get one of these <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s too!</p>
<p>Being <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ably technophilic, you feel a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of exuberance rise 
              within you as you skim through all the technological developments 
              crammed into the last few years. LEDs replacing bulbs in traffic 
              lights, ticketless air travel with what look like ATMs for check-in, 
              autonomous computing, <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-folding <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">supercomputer</a>s, terahertz 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s, computing devices made from <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, glassy 
              metals, <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">laser</a> tweezers for grabbing <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, and "sensemaking" 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> sniffing out <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a>s of terrorist activity.</p>
<p>There's even an explosive <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of extra-solar <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s 
              known. During those three years, their numbers have swollen from 
              single figures to well over a hundred. Work in <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a>s and therapeutic 
              cloning seems to have zipped ahead, despite political opposition. 
              These people have goats making silk; these folks have turned stem 
              cells into multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> types; and Medtronic is hooking up pacemakers 
              to the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and handing out high-tech wands for patients to 
              transmit internal <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to their doctor. </p>
<p>Take a small historical step back and these innovations seem like 
              magic. As <a class="thought" href="entries/clarke_entry.html">Arthur C. Clarke</a> put it: "Any sufficiently advanced technology 
              is indistinguishable from magic." Here's a corollary 'law': "Any 
              sufficiently distinguished technology is magical." Modern magic 
              consists of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>-at-a-distance and environments and non-human 
              voices that respond to you in a unique way.</p>
<p>Those super-muscular mice, genetically <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered to overproduce 
              IGF-1 are fascinating, not to mention the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers who connected 
              multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cells with <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> chips. The new <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s are scary, 
              but you can't believe that bioscientists decoded the SARS <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> in just six days. But then, other groups are seriously talking 
              about being on the brink of one-day personal genome sequences for 
              humans.</p>
<p>With all this technological rush, business must have been great! 
              But wait what's this? Deflation fears? Massive downsizing? Bankruptcies 
              at record highs?</p>
<p>Anyone who missed the last three years only to catch up with events 
              all at once might easily be baffled by this curious combination 
              of economic malaise and business gloom alongside charging technological 
              progress. A broader understanding would resolve this perplexity. 
              You might note that despite all the sorry talk in business, <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> 
              has remained far above its trend of the previous two decades. In 
              2002, the annual rate of output per worker grew a healthy 4.8%. 
              That compares with a 1.3% productivity growth rate in the 1980s 
              to early 1990s. </p>
<p>Clearly some businesses are finally figuring out how to reconfigure 
              their processes, organizational <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s, and incentive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s 
              to make use of the expensive IT systems they were buying. At the 
              same time, clusters of these technologies are adapting to the people 
              who use them. When this co-<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> and adaptation of technologies 
              and practices is complete, the technology becomes invisible (as 
              John Seely Brown and others have put it).</p>
<p>While business has suffered the collapse of the overhang of irrational 
              exuberance, it's clear that technological advance is not only continuing 
              ever faster, but some companies are using it craftily to push ahead. 
              Companies as diverse as Wal-Mart, <a class="thought" href="entries/dell_entry.html">Dell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>, Cemex, General 
              Motors, <a class="thought" href="entries/cisco_entry.html">Cisco</a> Systems, DuPont, and Harrah's are putting powerful 
              technologies together with reshaped business processes and <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s 
              to power their generation of value. </p>
<p>Clearly, technological and business advance does not move along 
              in tandem. Most companies are botching their IT installations due 
              to ignoring the cultural and psychological dimensions. Others are 
              using new IT to run faster but in the wrong direction, following 
              a faulty strategy map. The most extreme technocentric prognosticators 
              ignore such factors in their projections of imminent runaway change. 
              Chips may be a thousand times smaller and faster, but the practical 
              effect on our activities is much less. As economist Brian Arthur 
              has argued in detail, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> repeatedly shows a long lag time between 
              technological <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> and productive use.</p>
<p>We face problems even if we've figured out how to work with new 
              technologies. Our PCs outrun yesterday's supercomputers, yet we 
              spend precious time deleting <a class="thought" href="entries/spam_entry.html">spam</a>, hunting down viruses, reinstalling 
              drivers, and calling tech support. (<a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> recognizes these problems 
              as an opportunity to address with their "autonomic computing" <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.) 
              Drug companies use remarkable <a class="thought" href="entries/bioinformatics_entry.html">bioinformatics</a> tools to discover drug 
              targets and winnowing possibilities, along with new collaboration 
              and information management tools. Yet, they must still work through 
              an expensive and arduous testing and approval process. New technologies 
              enable but don't guarantee comparable advances in practice or business 
              results.</p>
<h2>Deciphering the Drivers, or, How to Ride a Rocket with Three Engines</h2>
<p>The technocentric, pure-IT-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>s who point to a trillionfold 
              growth in computing power per dollar over the last century, need 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> this gap. Yet their charts of exponential or even double-exponential 
              trends look promising when you consider that each doubling of power 
              per dollar is bigger than the last&amp;#8212and bigger and bigger and 
              bigger. Eight doublings amounts to a lowly 256. 16 doublings yields 
              5,536. 32 doublings (half the squares on the chessboard) comes to 
              a mighty 4.295 billion. But at the end of the chessboard, with 64 
              doublings, we have 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 (18.447 quintillion).</p>
<p>Initial doublings may not change much (whether we're measuring 
              in instructions per second or simply in dollars), but doubling of 
              extremely large numbers gets interesting. As the core technologies 
              get faster, tinier, smarter, and more adaptive, the impact on business 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> in general, expands. Gene sequencers that speed up the 
              process from four years to two years are good. But <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that 
              could sequence your personal <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> sequence in a day at a reasonable 
              price will thoroughly alter the <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/pharmaceutical_entry.html">pharmaceutical</a> 
              industry and the structure of healthcare. We are reaching tipping 
              points with fuel cells and microturbines, <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> speed, 
              reliability, and security, inexpensive RFID tags for every individual 
              product, and with practically real-time customer and market-sensing 
              and responding systems.</p>
<p>The rocket fuel of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>&#8212;smaller, faster, 
              cheaper, ubiquitous&#8212;is far from the only factor powering technological 
              acceleration. If we peer with a wide field of vision, we can see 
              a second potent driver of surprising, disruptive, game-changing 
              developments.' Not only are advances in individual fields standing 
              on the ever-broader and taller shoulders of their predecessors, 
              they are sending out shoots in diverse directions while running 
              into other streams of technological development. The result: intersection, 
              combination, blending, cross-fertilization and mutation, deflection, 
              penetration, coalescence and fusion.</p>
<p>This intersecting of fields occurs in fits and spasms&#8212;unpredictable 
              and astonishing. Yet, we remain far from E.O. Wilson's scientific 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/dream_entry.html">dream</a> of "<a class="thought" href="entries/consilience_entry.html">consilience</a>"&#8212;the deep, systematic, unified perspective 
              on far-flung fields of study. Even the cross-fertilizations we are 
              seeing are producing remarkable offspring. Cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> 
              is feeding into behavioral finance and economics; nanofibers are 
              being woven into jeans, imbuing them with unprecedented stain resistance; 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mems_entry.html">MEMS</a> (microelectromechanical systems) and radio frequency ID tags 
              are colliding with supply chain optimization, global positioning, 
              customer analytics, and collaboration tools to enable <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> products, 
              services and solutions, along with reinvented business processes 
              and strategies. </p>
<p>A third driver of technological acceleration<a name="Here"></a>&#8212;systematization&#8212;overlaps 
              with and draws on the other two. When a field of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> becomes 
              systematized, it sets off a rapid period of progress. At the grandest 
              scale, we should thank Roger Bacon for systematizing <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> itself 
              into an empirical, disciplined <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a> of investigation. We may now 
              be seeing the beginnings of the systematization of innovation&#8212;the 
              perfect complement to and extension of the <a class="thought" href="entries/scientific_method_entry.html">scientific method</a>. (If 
              this remark sounds mysterious, you will find plenty of hints in 
              the Innovation Methods topics at ManyWorlds.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>.)</p>
<p>Descending from the abstract heights of Science and Innovation, 
              we can see the marks of systematization on individual disciplines. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> crawled along until the 1870s, when the periodic table 
              took shape. Over the following decades researchers and <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a>s 
              were able to vastly increase their discovery, <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, and output 
              of new chemical products. In turning the <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for knowledge from 
              haphazard to honed, systematization brings analytical rigor to <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ation. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">Biotechnology</a> appears to have reached a similar state of systematization 
              due to <a class="thought" href="entries/genomics_entry.html">genomics</a> and bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Biotechnology provides a good example of all three of these drivers 
              at work. The very term "bioinformatics" embodies the first two drivers. 
              IT companies from IBM to Oracle, are pushing hard into the biotech 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. An array of other technologies, all add momentum&amp;#8212from 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s that interpret cardiac rhythms, to brain implants 
              that control tremors, to high-resolution <a class="thought" href="entries/body_scan_entry.html">body scan</a>ners that reveal 
              incipient <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> clusters. Within biotechnology, genomics has much 
              promise. But to deliver on that promise, the second and third drivers

              forms of other "omics"&#8212;proteomics, glycomics, transcriptomics, 
              metabolomics, and even bibliomics&#8212;mining the published scientific 
              literature for unexpected connections between these fields.</p>
<p>It was still possible in the eighteenth century for the most highly 
              educated person to know most things about everything. Today's post-postmodern

              in others. This efflorescence of distributed human knowledge frustrates 
              the would-be know-it-all. More <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>antly, it confuses executive 
              decision-makers faced with a sense of vast but invisible threats 
              both within and beyond their industry. The very notion of an "industry" 
              with definable boundaries is fast losing its coherence amidst the 
              tech whirlwind. Leading companies like <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> understand this 
              well, fitting within their strategy, everything from software to

              to the convergence of Web services, service-oriented architecture, 
              loosely-coupled processes, collaborative product development. Add 
              to the mix, decentralized "open innovation" research, analytics 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_mining_entry.html">data mining</a>, and alternate-scenario simulations, and you have

<h2><a class="thought" href="entries/extinction_entry.html">Extinction</a> or Dominance?</h2>
<p>Companies that don't push hard to keep up and to see ahead will 
              perish ever faster as value zones move away, leaving them gasping 
              for revenues from mysteriously vanishing customers. If the dotcom

<p><i>"Nonreactive companies deal with changing consumer needs and 
              technologies by doing what they have always done . . ."</i></p>
<h2><b> </b> Prescient-Proactive Enterprises </h2>
<p>The main goal of this paper is to convey a sense of the depth, 
              power, and direction of technological change. I shall use the three 
              driving forces of acceleration, intersection, and systematization 
              to bring into focus seven major technological vectors of change. 
              Each of these vectors brings with it opportunities for future-ready 
              organizations to pull away from the pack. This section briefly creates 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> for the seven vectors or metatrends (trends of trends) 
              described below. You can learn more by exploring topic areas at 
              manyworlds.com, especially the topics Organizational Futures, Business 
              Technology Futures, and Advanced Forecasting and Planning.</p>
<p>How can you enhance your ability to "learn from the future"? Executives 
              may view the unknown future with a less romantic attitude than that 
              embodied in futurist F.M. Esfandiary's "nostalgia for the future". 
              Some peer ahead in fear, others with greed, and a few armed with 
              leading practices. The most advanced leaders are, what I call, Prescient-Proactive 
              Enterprises (PPEs). PPEs will achieve and sustain their leadership 
              due to two core qualities: A refined <b>foresight capability</b> 
              that senses existing, emerging and foreseeable technological logics; 
              plus an <b>executive ability</b> to act quickly and decisively to 
              take advantage of insights gained, and patterns recognized.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the scale of future-readiness, we find the <b>Nonreactive 
              Enterprise</b>. In such a company, no one has responsibility for 
              scanning for these extinction-level events. Forecasting and simulations 
              are unheard of in strategic plans. And leaders overconfidently believe 
              that they grasp the future intuitively, or that it will be insignificant, 
              or that they can adapt instantly without advance warning. Nonreactive 
              companies deal with changing consumer needs and technologies by 
              doing what they have always done, because "it's always worked for 
              us". The true nonreactive organization will perish quickly in all 
              but the slowest-moving (and continually shrinking) areas of the 
              market.</p>
<p><i>"Reactive enterprises know that being stationary amounts to 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> wish."</i></p>
<p><i>"Adaptive enterprises make an <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> out of quickly recognizing 
              change and responding flexibly."</i></p>
<p><i>"The <b>Prescient-Proactive Enterprise (PPE)</b> builds on the 
              adaptive enterprise, adding capabilities, processes, and future-focus 
              to see further ahead as well as in acting on that extended vision."</i></p>
<p>A rung above those blind business <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s we find the largest 
              cohort&#8212;the <b>Reactive Enterprise</b>. Reactive enterprises 
              know that being stationary amounts to a death wish. Reactive enterprises 
              can be highly sophisticated, making use of Five Forces and Balanced 
              Scorecard strategy frameworks, reengineering their processes to 
              meet changing competitive conditions, and eagerly adopting best 
              practices to catch up with the recognized leaders of the day.</p>
<p>At the third and penultimate level of organizational evolution 
              dwells the <b>Adaptive Enterprise</b>. This has much in common with 
              the "real-time enterprise" (RTE), making use of many of the latter's 
              IT-powered sense-and-respond processes, combined with improvisational 
              strategy and rapid decision-making. Yet, this is still driven by 
              a sense of the present: operating in &lt;I&gt;real-time&lt;/I&gt; 
              but not in future-time. Adaptive enterprises make an art out of 
              quickly recognizing change and responding flexibly.</p>
<p>The <b>Prescient-Proactive Enterprise (PPE)</b> builds on the adaptive 
              enterprise, adding capabilities, processes, and future-focus to 
              see further ahead as well as by acting on that extended vision. 
              A true PPE must have <i>both</i> of these <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>s&#8212;Prescience: 
              a sense of existing and emerging and foreseeable technological logics, 
              and Proactivity: an executive ability to act quickly and decisively, 
              taking advantage of insights gained, and patterns recognized.</p>
<p>Prescience is not like a state of enlightenment to be attained 
              once and held forever, but more like a future-oriented <i>kaizen</i>&amp;#8212a 
              continuous process of improving the organization's understanding 
              of possible futures. Many methods exist to try out (see the paper, 
              "Grasping the Future"), and different combinations will suit different 
              companies according to their current capabilities, leadership style 
              and organizational culture. Some of them will be heavily based on 
              using information technology, as in the case of "sensemaking" software, 
              simulations, modeling, or what Michael Schrage calls "hyperinnovation"&#8212;the 
              ability to virtually test vast numbers of possibilities in a short 
              time. </p>
<p><a name="OLE_LINK1"><font color="#000000">Most revolve around human 
              cognition and relationships along with a highly developed ability 
              to synthesize and interpret diverse information. These approaches 
              include:' Scanning widely for unexpected developments; open or collaborative 
              innovation for R&amp;D, idea futures markets, and using other networks 
              and alliances to draw on the foresight of others.' Additionally, 
              </font></a>on the cognitive side, being able to think outside your 
              assumptions, frames and biases. All of these approaches can feed 
              into and enrich scenario <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> practices.' This can help prevent 
              scenario thinking from degenerating into rationalizing assumptions 
              about the most likely future.</p>
<p>Proactivity includes a host of elements from product innovation, 
              business model innovation, and business process innovation and enhancement, 
              to all those leadership-driven, culturally-mediated, and decision-enabled 
              processes that translate ideas into action. Individuals and teams 
              must be responsible and accountable for creating and maintaining 
              the alliances and doing the scanning and other prescience processes, 
              as well as for devising and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ing innovative business models, 
              architectures, processes and products and services that embody the 
              flow of foresight. Strategists and technologists need to collaborate 
              to select, invent and deploy technologies of all kinds that assist 
              these processes.</p>
<p>Tying together prescience and proaction are continuous adaptive 
              learning processes, an adaptive-proactive culture, advanced decision-making 
              capabilities, and the best human capital development practices. 
              Obviously, building the capabilities of prescience and proactivity 
              will be highly challenging, but cannot be pursued further here. 
              You will find a rich source of information on many of these practices 
              and capabilities in ManyWorlds.com's topics of Organizational Futures, 
              Business Futures and Technology, Advanced Decision-Making, Technological 
              Innovation, R&amp;D, Advanced Forecasting and Planning, and Innovation 
              Processes.</p>
<p>Having created the context, the purpose of the remainder of this 
              paper is to draw out of the background <a class="thought" href="entries/noise_entry.html">noise</a>, some signals from 
              the future. This means using the frame of the three drivers&amp;#8212acceleration, 
              intersection and systematization&#8212;to bring into focus, major 
              waves or vectors of technology-driven or mediated change. The aim 
              is not to produce an impossibly complete list or perfect categorization, 
              but to stimulate your own ongoing observation, making changes more 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/salient_entry.html">salient</a> in your mind and in your organization.</p>
<h2><b>Technology Vectors&#160;</b></h2>
<p>This section of the paper will present a structured perspective 
              to make sense of the panoply of technological changes. The previously 
              identified drivers&amp;#8212Acceleration, Intersection and Systematization&#8212;helped 
              to filter the apparently formless range of changes. I ended up with 
              seven primary vectors or metatrends. Each of these consists of technological 
              trends, often themselves complex in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. The vectors lie at a 
              level of <a class="thought" href="entries/abstraction_entry.html">abstraction</a> intended to assist each person to make sense 
              out of all the disconnected pieces of information we absorb daily. 
            </p>
<p>At this level, the vectors themselves should remain useful tools 
              for many years, even as their <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s continue to develop and 
              shift. Yet, even these high-level trends of trends will eventually 
              cease to act as an effective map. This point will be obvious to 
              many readers, but bears emphasizing, given the human mind's penchant 
              for clinging rigidly to any structure in the face of confusing <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.</p>
<p>It should be equally obvious, given the limited length of this 
              paper, that I make no pretense at anything close to a complete list 
              of important existing and emerging technologies within the vectors. 
              These seven vectors should stimulate each of us to recognize additional 
              and new technologies and trends by priming our minds. So long as 
              we are aware of the nature of the vectors as cognitive frames, we 
              can use them to filter and structure incoming information without 
              distortion.</p>
<p>What are these seven vectors? In short, they are:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Ubiquitous Intelligence Vector</li>
<li>The Complexity Vector</li>
<li>The Infobiotech Vector</li>
<li>The Dematerialization Vector</li>
<li>The Infosphere Management Vector</li>
<li>The Materials Vector</li>
<li>The Relationship Vector</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is intended not as a detailed account of hundreds 
              of technologies, but as a pointer to them and as a rough map of 
              their interactions. So, for each of the vectors, you will find a 
              short explanation followed by a list of the technologies and technology-infused 
              trends. To dig up more information on any of the components of the 
              vectors, I have suggested the most relevant topics on ManyWorlds.com. 
              Alternatively, simply go to the search options, select All for <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> 
              type as well as All for fields to search, then type in the search 
              word and see what turns up. Finally, you will find almost a hundred 
              relevant pieces of content related to this paper. Just choose the 
              lowest level of relevance to see all of them, or set it to 3 or 
              higher to reduce the number of items. (By doing this, you will be 
              tapping into vector #5&#8212;The Infosphere Management Vector.)</p>
<p>You will find considerable overlapping, as one technology or trend 
              often has major effects on more than one vector. As programmers 
              used to be fond of saying: That's a feature, not a <a class="thought" href="entries/bug_entry.html">bug</a>.</p>
<h2>Ubiquitous Intelligence</h2>
<p>"Every breath you take, every step you make, I'll be watching you." 
              The words of that tune by The Police sound ominous, but sum up the 
              trend toward ubiquitous intelligence. Here you will find everything 
              from today's instant messaging systems and the <a class="thought" href="entries/xml_entry.html">XML</a> standard to the 
              far extreme of a world where every thing is a thing that thinks, 
              senses, and responds to humans, a world where "<a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> becomes <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a>". 
              This most outlying point will make more sense after combining the 
              component of Ubiquitous Intelligence with those of the Materials 
              Vector.</p>

<h2>Complexity Vector</h2>
<p>Whereas the Ubiquitous Intelligence vector primarily involves tech 
              adapting to us, the Complexity vector involves us using improved 
              understanding of complexity to affect the environment. However, 
              there will be increasing crossover of the two vectors as technologies 
              and people co-evolve and co-adapt. The two vectors touch most closely 
              in the area of instinctual computing. The Complexity vector revolves 
              around understanding both negative (governing, suppressing, balancing) 
              and positive (reinforcing) feedback loops, and knowing how and when 
              to intervene to produce desired results&#8212;whether that means 
              preventing gridlock or a heart attack. These feedback loops and 
              complex systems include both natural and designed (or cultivated), 
              the latter usually being fast feedback loops. Using feedback to 
              understand and manage complexity will give us many new abilities 
              but, as Michael Malone put it in "Feedback <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a>", we "will be 
              asked to "surrender to machines reacting to the world far quicker 
              than we are".</p>

                instinctual computing, many of the same technologies are relevant 
                to Ubiquitous Intelligence, but emphasizing different aspects. 
                Autonomic computing systems, according to an IBM viewpoint, are 
                characterized by qualities such as self-knowledge, an inherent 
                optimization ability using control theory and decision support, 
                self-protection using &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Pattern Recognition')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Pattern Recognition')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;pattern recognition&lt;/a&gt;, social network analysis, 
                visualization, and biometrics; and they anticipate how to optimize 
                availability of resources while staying hidden in the background&lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As companies such as DuPont will happily tell you, the age of innovation 
              in materials is far from over. In fact, we have entered a golden 
              age for new materials, enabled by a range of technologies, including 
              some of those already mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Component Technologies and Trends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; 
            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Polymers&amp;#8212polymer skin, polymer nanotechnology, and "plastic 
                spintronics" &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Foldable computer screens and "electronic ink"&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Superstrong materials&amp;#8212including "glassy metals" that have 
                amorphous rather than crystalline structures that makes them more 
                resistance to corrosion and fracture, as well as stronger. &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Nanotubes&amp;#8212starting with buckminsterfullerene, this field 
                continues to expand rapidly, while driving down the price of nanotubes. 
                As yields grow, prices will fall rapidly from the recently cost 
                of around ten times that of gold. Nanotubes have a tensile strength 
                60 times that of steel, low weight, stability, flexibility, and 
                good heat conductance, giving them a wide range of applications 
                from &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Microelectronics')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Microelectronics')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;microelectronics&lt;/a&gt; to batteries, flat-panel displays, &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Memory')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Memory')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; 
                chips, and wireless applications made possible by the discovery 
                of nanotube field emission. &lt;/li&gt;

                monitor biological experiments great sensitivity. One application 
                is "magnetodendrimers" that have been used to track stem cells 
                after implantation in the brains of rats. These and other "nanotube" 
                drugs could mechanically block viruses from receptors and respond 
                to &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Bacteria')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Bacteria')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;l threats much faster &lt;/li&gt;

              it a Relationship Economy in several senses. Information technology 
              does far more than make things smaller and faster. When IT is matched 
              by psychological and cultural intelligence, it can enable entirely 
              new forms of collaboration and cooperation. Millions of us have 
              used infotech to build new, virtual communities, while teenagers 
              are using it to make up their own &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Language')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Language')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; for instant messaging

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi there,
&lt;br&gt;
Sorry but i am not impressed with Max's version of the future. 
&lt;br&gt;
just another set of banalities...... what is the unique
&lt;br&gt;
feature of the information (transparent) economy? 
&lt;br&gt;
Does it provide a better (more exititing) life? If the answer
&lt;br&gt;
is yes  yes pls explain to whom exactly? If reality does
&lt;br&gt;
not conmform well with Extopian's perseption -
&lt;br&gt;
let's forget about it!! Only positive facts count!!!
&lt;br&gt;
it is quite naive point of view.
&lt;br&gt;
best regards
&lt;br&gt;
vladimir

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt;We are beginning to climb the wall toward almost vertical ascent--a period where each wave of change comes more quickly than the one before.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Max's future doesn't seem to take into account that it will be dominated by two verticle curves: the curve of population growth will be riding right beside the curve of change and will have a huge impact on what changes take place.  We have produced more people on earth in the last century than we produced in all the previous centuries.  The population curve is so close to straight up that the population is doubling within the lifetime of single individuals.  Anyone born after 1950 has seen the population double once.  Some of us may live to see it double twice in our lifetimes.  
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
What effect will that have on the technology curve?  If the clash of civilizations leads to a struggle for the land, war and its consequences could wipe out a great deal of what we are accomplishing today.  We've just seen what it can do for commerce and the money markets.  A single act that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center sent the airline industry into a tailspin and the stock market, too.  
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Now multiply that by the effects of a divided world with two sides lashing out at each other with ever larger loads of bombs and greater acts of sabotage.  Ground Zero in New York could become the model for all of civilization.  The vertical towers of population and progress can fall as rapidly as they rose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The doubling of humanity every several decades is a factor too small to interfere with some other faster trends.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
When the number of people will double next time - the total computing power will go up billions of times.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Long before that - the Singularity will break.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
But I do agree, that if will be no Singularity - the hell will come to Earth in the form of overpopulation and it's consequences. One of them are diseases. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
And if the Singularity is not possible - the stoping those plagues - is also probably not.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The amount of human suffering would be unprecedented.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
We need the Singularity as badly as the next generation of antibiothics.

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to read this article but all those orange words made it impossible. What's the deal with that? Oh I get it now ... I'm supposed to click on all those words like "information" and "history" and "future" to find out what they mean. Hypertext is silly. Max More is a silly name. The only value of the future (and futurists) is entertainment!
