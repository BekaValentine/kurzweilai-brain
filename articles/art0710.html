<div class="TeaserText">Online virtual worlds have the power to accelerate and catalyze the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As AGIs involved in this metaverse become progressively more intelligent from their interaction with the social network of human beings and reach human-level intelligence (the Singularity), they will already be part of the human social network. If we build them right and teach them right, they will greet us with open arms.</div>

<h2>Virtual Worlds as the Catalyst for an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a></h2>
<p>The AI  field started out with grand dreams of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-level artificial general  <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. During the last half-century,  enthusiasm for these grand AI dreams&#8212;both within the AI profession and in  <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> at large&#8212;has risen and fallen repeatedly, each <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> with a similar  <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> of high hopes and <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> hype followed by overall disappointment. Throughout these fluctuations, though,  <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development have steadily advanced on various fronts within AI and  allied disciplines.</p>
<p>Recently, in the first years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, AI 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> has been on the rise again, both within the AI field and 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> community as a whole. One possibility 
              is that this is just another fluctuation&#8212;another <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a> 
              of excessive enthusiasm and hype to be followed by another round 
              of inevitable disappointment (see McDermott, 2006 for an exposition 
              of this perspective). Another possibility is that AI's time is finally 
              near, and what we are seeing now is the early glimmerings of a rapid 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> phase in AI R&amp;D, such as has not been seen in the field&#8217;s 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> to date.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m placing my bets on the latter, more optimistic possibility. 
              I have many <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s for making this judgment, and in this essay 
              I&#8217;m going to focus on one of them--online virtual worlds, 
              and the power I see them as having to accelerate and catalyze the 
              development of artificial general intelligence. My thesis here is 
              that virtual worlds have the potential to serve as the &#8220;golden 
              path&#8221; to advanced AI, so that the first powerful nonhuman 
              intelligences on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> are likely to be resident in virtual worlds 
              such as Second <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a> or its descendants. This is a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> I&#8217;m 
              trying to actualize via my own current work using the Novamente 
              Cognition <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a> to control virtual agents in virtual worlds, via 
              collaborative projects between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.novamente.net/" target="_blank">Novamente 
              LLC</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.electricsheepcompany.com/" target="_blank">Electric 
              Sheep Company</a>. But it&#8217;s also something that I see as having 
              a fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance beyond any particular project, or any particular 
              approach to the nitty-gritty of AI design.</p>
<h1>Adequate Interaction in Virtual Worlds Requires  AGI</h1>
<p>Whenever I  talk about AI I like to make the distinction between </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>narrow AI</strong>&#8212;programs that solve       particular, highly specialized types of problems </li>
<li><strong>general AI or AGI</strong>&#8212;programs with       the <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a> and self-understandings to come to grips with <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> problem       <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s and hence solve a wide variety of problem types</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike an AGI, a narrow AI <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> need not understand  itself or what it is doing, and it need not be able to generalize what it has  learned beyond its narrowly constrained problem domain. My principal point in this essay is that  virtual worlds are an ideal arena for the maturation of AGI <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>. They have the potential to provide AGIs with  effective <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>; and, they are a <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> arena in which AGI rather than  narrow-AI is going to be required for dramatic success. Most research work in the AI field today has  to do with narrow AI rather than directly with AGI; but my prediction is that  during the next 3&#8211;7 years, successes of AGI in the virtual-worlds domain may  start to cause a major change in this bias. </p>
<p>A few examples  may clarify the narrow-AI/AGI distinction.  For example, a narrow-AI program for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deep_Blue" target="_blank">playing chess</a>, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> how  powerful, need not be able to transfer any of its strategic or <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ological  insights to Shogi (Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a>) or checkers... and probably not even to  chess variants like Fisher random chess (though a human programmer might be  able to take some of the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> implicit in a narrow-AI chess playing  program and use this to make a better program for playing other games; in this  case the general intelligence exists mainly in the human being not the  programs). A narrow-AI program for  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge" target="_blank">driving a car in the desert</a>   need not be able to utilize its knowledge to drive a car in the city or  a motorcycle in the desert. A narrow-AI  program for parsing English cannot learn any other <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, whether or not the  other language has a similar syntactic and semantic <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>. Or to mention an area in which I&#8217;ve done a  lot of research myself,  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://biomind.com/research.htm" target="_blank">biomedical research</a>&#8212;a narrow-AI program for diagnosing Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome will always be useless for diagnosing other <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s such as,  say, Chronic Upper Airway Cough Syndrome (though the same narrow-AI framework  may be used by humans to create narrow-AI programs for diagnosing various sorts  of diseases ). Or, finally, to give an  example we can all relate to from our own <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, Figures 1 and 2  illustrate the <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> in which the wonderful <a class="thought" href="entries/google_entry.html">Google</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/search_engine_entry.html">search engine</a> fails to  bridge the gap between narrow and general AI&#8212;it understands some of our  queries perfectly, and in other cases fails miserably due to a lack of  <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>ual understanding borne of the fact that it acts on the level of words  rather than meanings.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 1: Given a&#160;  simple question such as &#8220;How many years does a pig live?&#8221; Google (as of  October 2007) acts like a reasonably intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/query_entry.html">query</a>  answering <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 2: Given a question requiring just a little <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of  commonsense background knowledge, such as &#8220;How many years does a dead pig  live?,&#8221; Google&#8217;s (as of October 2007) inadequacies as a question-answerer  become apparent.&#160;&#160; Note that Google&#8217;s  answer to &#8220;How many years does a pig live in captivity?&#8221; are about other  <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s than pigs (wolves, octupi, carp, etc.).&#160;  Google does not have enough sense to understand that the question is  about pigs.&#160; This specific problem could  be remedied through judicious application of narrow-AI language-processing  techniques (and startups like powerset.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a> are working on this), but without  AGI, there will always be many examples of this sort of obtuseness.</p>
<p>Clearly,  there are various roles for narrow AI in the metaverse (to use Neal  Stephenson&#8217;s (2000) term for the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of virtual worlds, made popular in  his classic SF novel Snowcrash; see also the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.metaverseroadmap.org/" target="_blank">Metaverse Roadmap</a>). Virtual worlds could use automated cars and  Google-like search engines; they could use chatbots on the level of <a href="www.alicebot.org" target="_blank">ALICE</a> as virtual shopkeepers.  Enterprising <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s are already moving to fill this niche, for  instance Daden Limited&#8217;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.daden.co.uk/pages/000406.html" target="_blank">Second Life chatbots</a>. In a similar vein, <a class="thought" href="entries/video_game_entry.html">video game</a>s&#8212;some of  which verge on being virtual worlds, such as MMOGs like World of Warcraft&#8212; often feature cleverly-constructed narrow AIs, serving as automated opponents  or teammates. A few games have even  included AIs with significant ability to learn or evolve (the Creatures games  and the Black and White series being the most notable examples).</p>
<p>However,  these sorts of narrow AIs in the metaverse  are not what I want to talk about here.  They&#8217;re worthwhile, but clearly, they&#8217;re not as impressive in the  metaverse domain as, say, <a class="thought" href="entries/deep_blue_entry.html">Deep Blue</a> is in the chess domain, or an AI-learned  diagnostic rule is in the medical domain.  Deep Blue could beat any human at chess, and in many cases AI-learned  diagnostic rules can out-diagnose any human physician. Chess and medical  diagnosis are examples of problems that humans solve using general intelligence&#8212;but that, in a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> computing <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>, have found to be at least equally  amenable to highly specialized narrow-AI techiques as to AGI methods. But the metaverse presents different sorts of  challenges. Narrow-AI based chatbots and  automated virtal car drivers and warfighters are drastically inferior in functionality  to <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s carrying out similar functions but controlled by human beings. Apparently, social interaction in virtual  worlds is a problem domain that requires general intelligence on roughly the  human level, and is not tractably amenable to narrow-AI techniques.</p>
<p>Adequate  interaction in virtual worlds, in my view, is very likely to require powerful  AGI systems&#8212;and this hypothesis is most interesting to contemplate in  conjunction with the observation that <em>virtual  worlds seem to provide an ideal environ for the creation and maturation of  powerful AGI systems</em>.</p>
<p>As I noted  above (and as many others have observed as well; see e.g. <a class="thought" href="entries/hall_entry.html">J. Storrs Hall</a>&#8217;s  2006 book <em>Beyond AI</em>) the AI research community to date, in both academia and  industry has focused largely on narrow-AI.  But in recent years this is already shifting a bit toward AGI, as  evidenced by an increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of conference special sessions, journal  special issues and edited volumes focused in the AGI area (Cassimatis, 2006;  Goertzel and Wang, 2007). As virtual  worlds become increasingly important, I believe we will see a more dramatic  shift in the research community toward the investigation of AGI systems and  related scientific issues. Because, I  believe, the embodiment of AGI systems in virtual worlds is going to lead to  palpably exciting results during the next few years&#8212;results that are exciting  on multiple levels: scientifically, visually, and in terms of human <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>s  and social systems. While the  scientific community can be stubborn, AI science like any other kind is  ultimately empirically based, and the minds of all but the most hide-bound  scientists can be shifted by dramatic observable results. My prediction is that &#8220;AI in virtual worlds&#8221;  may well serve as the catalyst that re-focuses the AI research community on the  grand challenge of creating AGI at the human level and beyond, which was after  all the vision on which the AI field was founded.</p>
<h1>Virtual-World Embodiment as a Path to  Human-Level AGI</h1>
<p>I often say  there are four key aspects to creating a human-level AGI:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Cognitive <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a></strong> (the       overall design of an AGI system: what parts does it have, how do they       connect to each other)</li>
<li><strong><a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_representation_entry.html">Knowledge representation</a></strong> (how does       the system internally store declarative, procedural and episodic       knowledge; and now does it create its own representation for knowledge of       these sorts in new domains it encounters)</li>
<li><strong><a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> </strong>(how does it learn new       knowledge of the types mentioned above; and how does it learn how to       learn, and so on)</li>
<li><strong>Teaching methodology</strong> (how is it       coupled with other systems so as to enable it to gain new knowledge about       itself, the world and others)</li>
</ul>
<p> Here I&#8217;m going to focus on the fourth of these. For my views 
              on the other three aspects, you are directed to references such 
              as (Goertzel, 2006, 2007; Goertzel et al, 2004) and to a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0701.html" target="_top">prior 
              article of mine on Kurzweilai.net</a>. My main point here is to 
              suggest that virtual worlds present unprecedented and unparalleled 
              opportunities for AGI teaching methodology&#8212;which, combined 
              with appropriate solutions for the other three key aspects of the 
              AGI problem, may have a catalytic effect and accelerate <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> 
              toward AGI dramatically.</p>
<p>From an AI  theory perspective, virtual worlds may be viewed as one possible way of  providing AI systems with <em>embodiment</em>. The issue of the necessity for embodiment in  AI is an old one, with great AI minds falling on both sides of the debate. The classic GOFAI systems (Good Old-Fashioned  AI; see Crevier, 1993) are embodied only in a very limited sense; whereas  <a class="thought" href="entries/brooks_entry.html">Rodney Brooks</a> (1999) and others have argued for real-world robotic embodiment  as the golden path to AGI. My own view  is somewhere in the middle: I think embodiment is very useful though probably  not strictly necessary for AGI, and I think that at the present time, it is  probably more generally worthwhile for AI researchers to spend their time  working with virtual embodiments in digital simulation worlds, rather than  physical robots. Toward that end the  focus of my current AGI research&#8212;which I&#8217;ll discuss more in a few paragraphs&#8212;involves connecting AI learning systems to virtual agents in virtual worlds,  including Second Life.</p>
<p>The notion  of virtually embodied AI is nowhere near a new one, and can be traced back at  least to Winograd&#8217;s (1972) classic <a class="thought" href="entries/shrdlu_entry.html">SHRDLU</a> system. However, technology has advanced a long way  since SHRDLU&#8217;s day, and the power of virtual embodiment to assist AI is far  greater in these days of Second Life, Word of Warcraft, HiPiHi, Creatures, Club  Penguin and the like. In 2004 and 2005  my colleagues and I <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>ed with virtual embodiment in simple game-engine  type domains, customized for AGI development (see Figure 3), which has  advantages in terms of the controllability of the environment; but I am now  leaning toward the conclusion that the greater advantage is to be had by making  use of the masses of potential AGI teachers present in commercial virtual  worlds.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"><img alt="Figure 3" border="1" height="369" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_3.jpg" width="598"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 3: The Novamente Cognition Engine controlling a  simple embodied <a class="thought" href="entries/agent_entry.html">agent</a> in a 3D simulation world.&#160;  The AI controls the smaller agent and a human controls the larger  agent.&#160; This screenshot is from a  simulation in which the human is trying to teach the AI the Piagetan concept of  &#8220;object permanence,&#8221; something that human babies typically learn during their  first year of life.&#160; In the overall  experiment from which this screenshot is drawn, the baby AI is supposed to  learn that when a toy has been placed inside a box, it tends to stay there even  after the lid of the box is closed, so that it will still be there when the lid  of the box is opened again.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p> Virtually  embodied AGI in virtual worlds may take many different forms, for instance (to  name just a handful of examples):</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>ambient       wildlife</li>
<li>virtual       pets (see Figure 4 for a narrow-AI virtual pet currently for sale in       Second Life)</li>
<li>virtual       babies for virtual-world residents to take care of, <a class="thought" href="entries/love_entry.html">love</a>, and teach       (Figure 8) </li>
<li>virtual       shopkeepers</li>
<li>virtual       job recruiters (see Figure 9 for a visual depiction: and note that dozens       of real-world companies are now using human-controlled Second Life avatars       to do job recruiting)</li>
<li>digital       twins, imitating users&#8217; avatars</li>
</ul>
<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"><img alt="Figure 4" border="1" height="491" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_4.jpg" width="593"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 4: A virtual dog currently for sale in the Second  Life virtual world, on the sim Pawaii, by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320/http://www.sldogs.com/" target="_blank">D&amp;D Dogs</a>. The  dog carries out a fixed repertoire of tricks, rather than learning new  behaviors, hence qualifying it as a &#8220;narrow AI&#8221; (to the extent that it is  intelligent at all).</p>
<p>To concretely understand the potential power of virtual  embodiment for AGI, in this essay I&#8217;ll focus mostly on just one possibility&#8212;a potential project my software company Novamente LLC has been considering  undertaking sometime during the next few years: a virtual talking parrot. But all of the possibilities mentioned above  are important and interesting, plus many others, and there is much to be gained  by exploring the detailed implications they lead to.</p>
<p>At the  moment Novamente, in collaboration with Electric Sheep Company, is experimenting  with simpler virtual animals in virtual worlds&#8212;nonlinguistic animals that can  carry out spontaneous behaviors while seeking to achieve their own goals  [Figure 5] and can also specifically be trained by human beings to carry out  novel tricks and other behaviors [Figure 6] (which were not programmed into  them, but rather must be learned by the AI on the fly). This current experimental work will be used  as the basis of a commercial product to be launched sometime in 2008. These simpler virtual animals are an  important first step, but I think the more major leap will be taken when  linguistic interaction is introduced into the mix&#8212;something that,  technologically is not at all far off.  Take a simpler virtual animal and add a language engine, integrated in  the appropriate way (and Novamente LLC, along with many other research groups,  already has a fairly powerful language engine)... and you&#8217;re on your way. Of course a virtual animal with a language  engine could be concretized many different ways but&#8212;inspired in part by Irene  Pepperberg&#8217;s (2000) groundbreaking work teaching an actual parrot complex  things like <a class="thought" href="entries/grammar_entry.html">grammar</a> and arithmetic&#8212;the specific scenario I&#8217;ve <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> about  most is a virtual talking parrot.</p>

<p>Imagine  millions of talking parrots spread across different online virtual worlds&#8212;all  communicating in simple English. Each parrot has its own local memories, its  own individual knowledge and habits and likes and dislikes&#8212;but there&#8217;s also a  common knowledge-base underlying all the parrots, which includes a common  knowledge of English.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"><img alt="Figure 7" border="1" height="422" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_7.jpg" width="527"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 7: A virtual parrot in Second Life.&#160; Right now virtual birds in Second Life don&#8217;t  display intelligent non-verbal behaviors, let alone possess the capability of  speech.&#160; But, virtual parrots that talk  would seem a very natural medium via which AI&#8217;s may progressively gain greater  and greater language understanding.</p>
<p>Next,  suppose that an adaptive language learning <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a> is set up (based on one of  the many available <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>s for such), so that the parrot-collective may  continually improve its language understanding based on interactions with  users. If things go well, then the parrots will get smarter and smarter at  using language, as time goes on. And, of course, with better language  capability, will come greater user appeal.</p>
<p>The idea of  having an AI&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> filled up with linguistic knowledge via continual  interaction with a vast number of humans, is very much in the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of the  modern Web. Wikipedia is an obvious example of how the &#8220;wisdom of crowds&#8221;&#8212;when properly channeled&#8212;can result in impressive collective intelligence. Google is ultimately an even better example&#8212;the PageRank algorithm at the core of Google&#8217;s technical success in <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>, is  based on combining <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from the Web links created by multi-millions of Website  creators. And the intelligent targeted <a class="thought" href="entries/advertising_entry.html">advertising</a> engine that makes Google its  billions of dollars is based on mining <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> created by the pointing and  clicking behavior of the one billion Web users on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> today. Like  Wikipedia and Google, the <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> of a talking-parrot tribe instructed by masses  of virtual-world residents will embody knowledge implicit in the combination of  many, many peoples&#8217; interactions with the parrots.</p>
<p>Another  thing that&#8217;s fascinating about virtual-world embodiment for language learning  is the powerful possibilities it provides for disambiguation of linguistic  constructs, and contextual learning of language rules. Michael Tomasello (2003), in his excellent  book <em>Constructing a Language</em>, has  given a very clear summary of the value of social interaction and embodiment  for language learning in human children.  For a virtual parrot, the test of whether it has used English correctly,  in a given instance, will come down to whether its human friends have rewarded  it, and whether it has gotten what it wanted. If a parrot asks for food  incoherently, it&#8217;s less likely to get food&#8212;and since the virtual parrots will  be programmed to want food, they will have motivation to learn to speak  correctly. If a parrot interpret a human-controlled avatar&#8217;s request &#8220;Fetch my  hat please&#8221; incorrectly, then it won&#8217;t get positive feedback from the avatar&#8212;and it will be programmed to want positive feedback. </p>
<p>The  intersection between linguistic experience and embodied perceptual/active  experience is one thing that makes the notion of a virtual talking parrot very  fundamentally different from the &#8220;chatbots&#8221; on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> today. The other major difference, of course, is the  presence of learning&#8212;chatbots as they currently exist rely almost entirely on  hard-coded lists of expert rules. But  the interest of many humans in interacting with chatbots suggests that virtual  talking parrots or similar <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s would be likely to meet with a large and  enthusiastic audience.</p>
<p>Yes, humans  interacting with parrots in virtual worlds can be expected to try to teach the  parrots ridiculous things, obscene things, and so forth. But still, when it  comes down to it, even pranksters and jokesters will have more fun with a  parrot that can communicate better, and will prefer a parrot whose statements  are comprehensible.</p>
<p>And of  course parrots are not the end of the story. Once the collective <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> of  throngs of human teachers has induced powerful language understanding in the  collective bird-brain, this language understanding (and the commonsense  understanding coming along with it) will be useful for many, many other  purposes as well. <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">Humanoid</a> avatars&#8212;both human-baby avatars that may serve as  more rewarding virtual companions than parrots or other virtual animals; and  language-savvy human-adult avatars serving various useful and entertaining  functions in online virtual worlds and games. Once AI&#8217;s have learned enough  that they can flexibly and adaptively explore online virtual worlds (and the  Internet generally) and gather information according to their own goals using  their linguistic facilities, it&#8217;s easy to envision dramatic acceleration in  their growth and understanding. </p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"><img alt="Figure 8" border="1" height="433" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_8.jpg" width="481"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 8:&#160; A virtual  baby in Second Life.&#160; Right now Second  Life babies are essentially just visuals, little more animated and responsive  than articles of clothing or physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s.&#160;  But, attaching AI to virtual babies may yield something much more  interesting: the capability for humans to help baby AGI&#8217;s ascent through the  stages of cognitive development, by interacting with them in virtual worlds.</p>
<p>A baby AI  has a lot of disadvantages compared to a baby human being: it lacks the  intricate set of inductive biases built into the human brain, and it also lacks  a set of teachers with a similar form and psyche to it&#8230; and for that matter,  it lacks a really rich body and world.  However, the presence of thousands to millions of teachers constitutes a  large advantage for the AI over human babies. And a flexible AGI framework will  be able to effectively exploit this advantage.</p>
<p>Google  doesn&#8217;t emulate the human brain, nor does Wikipedia, yet in a sense they both  display considerable intelligence. It  seems possible to harness the &#8220;wisdom of crowds&#8221; <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> underlying these  Internet phenomena for AGI, enabling AGI systems to learn from vast numbers of  appropriately interacting human teachers.  There are no proofs or guarantees about this sort of thing, but it does  seem at least plausible that this sort of mechanism could lead to a dramatic  acceleration in the intelligence of virtually-embodied AGI systems, and maybe  even on a time-scale faster than the pathway to <a class="thought" href="entries/singularity_entry.html">Singularity</a>-enabling AGI that  <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> has envisioned, which brain-scanning and <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> advances lead to  human-brain emulation, which then leads on to more general and powerful  <a class="thought" href="entries/transhuman_entry.html">transhuman</a> AGIs.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> In the Novamente Cognition Engine design we  have charted out a specific engineering pathway via which we believe this can  happen&#8212;what&#8217;s needed is more time spent on software <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation and  various related technical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>  science problems&#8212;and the human intelligence of a large number of virtual  world residents, interacting with Novamente-powered AGI systems. </p>
<p align="center" style="font-style: italic"><img alt="Figure 9" border="1" height="555" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_9.jpg" width="324"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 9:&#160; Intelligent  virtual agents in Second Life will have applications beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a>.&#160; This image shows a prototype virtual agent  designed to serve as a job interviewer, providing &#8220;initial screening and  filtering interviews&#8221; of job candidates, and then passing on the best ones to  human interviewers.&#160; Job interviewer  agents are not yet ready for deployment, and creating them based on the  Novamente Cognition Engine will still require a significant amount of  development work; but this sort of application is quite palpable and plausible  in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>One way to  conceptualize this advance is in terms of <a class="thought" href="entries/piaget_entry.html">Jean Piaget</a>&#8217;s famous stages of human  cognitive development, as illustrated in Figure 10. Figure 11 presents a more whimsical version  of Piaget, tied in specifically with the notion of AGI in virtual worlds.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Figure 10" border="1" height="346" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_10.jpg" width="550"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 10:&#160;  For AGI systems that are at least roughly humanlike in their cognitive  architecture, Piaget&#8217;s theory of the stages of cognitive  development is highly relevant.&#160; For  example the prototype virtual animals that Electric Sheep Company and Novamente  LLC are currently experimenting with in Second Life, are somewhere between the  Infantile and Concrete <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">Operation</a>al stages (what Piaget sometimes called  Pre-Operational).&#160; Via interacting with  humans and each other in virtual worlds, virtual agents may ascend the ladder  of development &#8211; eventually reaching stages of advancement inaccessible to  humans, via their ability to more fully introspect and self-improve.</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="Figure 11" border="1" height="537" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100621162320im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/goertzelagiarticle/fig_11.jpg" width="700"></p>
<p style="font-style: italic">Figure 11: A visual depiction of the forms that  virtually-embodied AGI&#8217;s might take as they ascend the Piagetan ladder.&#160; Once virtually embodied AGI&#8217;s achieve roughly  human-level intelligence, it may be worthwhile to link human minds and brains  with them in various ways, including potentially direct neural  interconnects.&#160; The ultimate stages go  beyond anything we can imagine, as illustrated by the final graphic shown, an  incomprehensibly superhuman supermind drawn from the online virtual world  Orion&#8217;s Arm.</p>
<h1>Conclusion (Hi Ho, Hi Ho, to the Metaverse We  Go)</h1>
<p> I am one of  the minority of the human race who believes that a technological Singularity is  almost surely coming. And, as this essay  hopefully has made clear, I am also part of an even smaller minority who  believes that the most probable path for the Singularity&#8217;s arrival involves AGI  in the online metaverse. I suspect that  both of these minorities will become  larger and larger as the next decade unfolds. </p>
<p>I certainly  don&#8217;t claim the metaverse is the only  possible route to Singularity. The rate  of progress of radical ideas and technologies is famously hard to predict. <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotech</a> or <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>&#8212;to name just  two possible technologies&#8212;could have a tremendous, Singularity-enabling  advance any year now, leapfrogging ahead of AGI and/or enabling advanced AGI in  ways we cannot now predict or comprehend.These possibilities need to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p>And I do  attach a lot of plausiblity to the scenario that Ray Kurzweil has elaborated in <em>The Singularity Is Near</em> and other  writings, in which software-based human brain emulation is the initial route  toward Singularity-enabling AGI.  However, my own educated guess is that we will achieve human-level AGI  first via other means, well before the brain-scanning route gets us there. Human uploads as Kurzweil projects will come&#8212;we will upload ourselves into virtual bodies, living in virtual worlds. But when we get there, I suggest, AGI systems  will be living there already&#8212;and if we build them right and teach them right,  they will greet us with open arms!</p>
<p>Singularity-wise,  one interesting aspect of the virtual-worlds route to AGI has to do with the  high level of integration it implies will occur between AGIs and human  society, coming right out of the gate.  Ray Kurzweil has suggested that, by the time of the Singularity, humans  may essentially be inseparable from the AI-incorporating technological  <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a> they have created. The  virtual-agents pathway makes very concrete one way in which this integration  might happen&#8212;in fact it might be the route by which AGI evolves in the first  place. </p>
<p>Right now many people consider themselves inseparable from their 
              cellphones, search engines, and so forth. Suppose that in the Internet 
              of 2015, Websites and <a class="thought" href="entries/word_processor_entry.html">word processor</a>s are largely replaced by some 
              sort of 3D immersive <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>&#8212;a superior Second Life with hardware 
              and software support far beyond what exists now in 2007&#8212;and 
              that artificially <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligent_agent_entry.html">intelligent agent</a>s are a critical part of this 
              &#8220;metaversal&#8221; Internet. Suppose that the AGIs involved 
              in this metaverse become progressively more and more intelligent, 
              year by year, due to their integration in the social <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of 
              human beings interacting with them. When the AGIs reach human-level 
              intelligence, they will be part of the human social network already. 
              It won&#8217;t be a matter of &#8220;us versus them&#8221;; in a 
              sense it may be difficult to draw the line. Singularity-scenario-wise, 
              this sort of path to AGI lends itself naturally to what Stephan 
              Bugaj and I, in <em>The Path to <a class="thought" href="entries/posthuman_entry.html">Posthuman</a>ity</em>, called the &#8220;Singularity 
              Steward&#8221; scenario, in which AGI systems interact closely with 
              human society to guide us through the dramatic transitions that 
              are likely to characterize our future.</p>

I've a question about the talking parrot:
<br>
Will the parrot talk (and here) with sound, 
<br>
or text ? This question may seem irrelavent
<br>
(with the turing test in our mind), but I think
<br>
the reason that babies learn to talk in the auditory sense, is that this is "easier" then
<br>
using "abstract" symbols such as text.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand I understand the problem of 
<br>
 "preprocessing-the-speech-in-order-to-understand".  , because you have to do lots of things that are not necessarly AGI.   </p></td>

Humans don't learn purely by reinforcement learning, at all.  There is a subtle combination of reinforcement, imitation and correction going on in child language learning.  And, there is some level of inductive bias going on too, biasing the search for patterns in linguistic input -- though almost surely not in as rigid a way as Chomsky thought with his "principles and parameters" approach (which he has lately semi-abandoned, by the way).

My approach to AGI is described in some papers at novamente.net ... it is not fully described in this article which has a particular focus on explaining the value of virtual embodiment for AGI rather than explaining my AGI design itself.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I personaly think that what we should all be focussing on is physical immortality first and then try to develop another world of infinite possibillities.           But what everyone must understand is that Alcor may not be completely understood at this moment,but it is on the verge of possible success. And no matter what it is that we die of,if it be cancer or aging,which aging is the most popular way of dieing that all of America needs to try to cure,that 
<br>
Alcor could,with a chance,actually preserve your you with all your memories and whatever it is that makes you,you!!!       And what most people dont get is that they think that cryonics conflicts with religion,and there for is not possible to be revived or just back to your normal state since when you die from aging or non accidental injurie,your not dead,just unconcsious.     And that trying to keep us living as long as possible has been a custom of our kind since cavemen,and that even if we were to live to even 5000,it would not be a sin even if there was a god with certain religious rules.               So basically,when we are trying to achieve physical immortality,that it isn't a sin because we are trying to cure cancer and other physical weaknesses.      So in conclusion,we should all be trying to defeat aging first and cancer second.      And that most immportalntly,we should all be funding Alcor for their cryonics research.............why????,you ask?                                                 BECAUSE IT MEANS YOUR LIFE AND THE LIVES OF ALL THE ONES YOU CARE ABOUT!!!!!!!!!                                                                 And I respect each and everyone of your religions,but even if religion was true,we still should be working on life extension because we do not know FOR A FACT what will happen to us when you die,although im pretty sure we all know by now what realy happens,and that we can still be religios and sighn up for cryonics,or just support physical immortality and cryonics.        Let me tell you something,Cryonics at Alcor is the best ting in everyones life,and the only reason that its not introduced as a normal medical procedur is that it dosent have the money and the reason it dosent have the money is because people are too stupid to realize that we need to be frozen and immortal,at least as long as we can.

<br>
I believe you've missed it.  If you study the philosophy of mind over the decades, you come to the conclusion that true AI requires actual experiences.  These sensory experiences can be in a virtual 3D world, or the real one (via camera, audio and tactile equipment).  Once actual experience are encoded, the AI must begin to make comparisons between them, eventually to the point of abstractions and ideas.  All our understanding comes essentials from sensory experiences that we later on abstract into ideas and comparisons.
<br>
What you describe above is the classic misunderstanding of AI, which is simply mimicry under different names.  </p></td>
