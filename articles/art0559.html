<div class="TeaserText">The future generations of nanotechnology will rely on being able to effectively arrange atoms. Molecular manufacturing, and the use of molecular assemblers to hold and position molecules, will be key to the future, controlling how molecules react and allowing scientists to build complex structures with atomically precise control. In this essay, Dr. Drexler discusses the benefits and challenges of future molecular manufacturing. </div>

<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea is simple: where chemists mix <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in solution, 
              allowing them to wander and bump together at random, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614011326/http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html" target="_blank">molecular

<p>Picture an industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> arm standing next to an unfinished 
              work piece. A conveyor belt supplies the arm with parts, each mounted 
              on a handle. Step after step, the belt advances, the <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> grips 
              a fresh handle, plugs the attached part into the work piece, then 
              puts the empty handle back on the belt. Eventually, the work piece 
              is finished and another belt moves it away, shifting a new unfinished 
              work piece into place. </p>
<p>To picture a molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> in a manufacturing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, imagine 
              that all the parts are measured in nanometers, and that the transferred 
              parts are just a few atoms, shifting from handle to work piece through 
              a chemical reaction at a specific site. An <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> works as part 
              of a larger <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that prepares tools, puts them on the conveyor, 
              and controls the robotic positioning mechanism. </p>
<p>This will be a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that no one will build any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> soon. 
              Indeed, no one is even trying to build molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s today, 
              because <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> is still in its infancy. We can see a path 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, just as the rocketry pioneers of the 1930s and 1940s 
              could see a path to the Moon. But like those pioneers, we aren't 
              ready to attempt the final goal. They knew they must first launch 
              many satellites, just as we must first build many molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
            </p>
<h2><b>Confusion and controversy: Developing <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s</b></h2>
<p>While nano assembly has been described as "building things 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>," an <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> that has caught on in the press, 
              this is a misconception. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will build with atomic 
              precision by mechanically guiding chemical reactions that typically 
              add a few atoms at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but some <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have criticized 
              this misconception as if it were the actual proposal. It is correct 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s can't build things by using tiny tweezers to pick 
              up and put down atoms one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but even from the start this 
              was never the idea. </p>
<p>The apparent controversy over "molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s" 
              is thus an illusion: the critics are talking about something else. 
              The idea of building things by mechanically guiding chemical reactions 
              has withstood scientific scrutiny for over 20 years, and seems sound. 
              It is <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to move on, to consider the consequences of molecular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and what they will be able to build. </p>
<h2><b>Understanding advanced capabilities</b></h2>
<p> We can catch a glimpse of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies because we sometimes 
              can understand things that we can't yet build. <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, and applied <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> all provide useful perspectives. 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">Chemistry</a> shows what can happen when reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s meet. By 
              using molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>ry to guide reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, similar <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s 
              can be built at larger scales. The products can be stronger, tougher, 
              and more capable than the delicate <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s found in living cells. 
            </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a> shows that molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s can exist, can be <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med 
              with genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, and can build more molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a> 
              shows that the products of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s can be as cheap 
              as potatoes. Molecular manufacturing will make a far wider range 
              of products for similarly low costs. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering shows that strong, precise parts can be combined to 
              make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, robots, and a host of useful gadgets. Applied <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, 
              aided by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> modeling, shows that these sorts of <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s can 
              be built from atomically precise parts of nanometer scale. These 
              glimpses of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies are enough to establish the potential 
              for molecular manufacturing. </p>
<h2><b>Directions and applications</b> </h2>
<p>Molecular manufacturing will bring both great opportunities and 
              great dangers. Nanocomputers will extend desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al power 
              by a factor of a billion or more. Nanoscale sensors, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, 
              and tools will bring surgical control to the molecular level, enabling 
              a revolution in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614011326/http://www.nanomedicine.com/" target="_blank">medicine</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">Light</a>, strong, and inexpensive aerospace <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s will make spaceflight 
              easy. </p>
<p>But the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>'s faster, cheaper, cleaner production of better 
              products will also bring disruption. Advanced lethal and nonlethal 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s, deployed quickly and cheaply, could make the world a more 
              dangerous place. The list of consequences is long, much of it sounding 
              like <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>. </p>
<p>The tools required to develop <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a>nologies are typically small 
              and unobtrusive. The pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is accelerating worldwide. 
              Some suggest stopping it, but it is hard to imagine how. Thus, it 
              seems that this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, with all its challenges and opportunities, 
              is an unavoidable part of our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I'd say the most promising field to work in as the future unfolds is bioengineering.  All of life uses DNA to create the most fantastic shapes and materials.  How they do that and what else can by done using nature's mothodology is the key to how manufactoring will take place in the future.  Self assembly beats factory assembly by any measure you can think of.  The question is where can we do it?
<br>
<br>
In biological systems, the cell is the environment in which the manufacturing takes place.  Cells then replicate themselves to make more massive structures.  But the reason the cell works as a manufacturing medium is because it is a small, enclosed space that keeps all of the necessary materials churning within it so that randomn motion can bring them together.  Try that in a more spacious environment and that same random motion would keep them far apart.  What we need for bioengineering is either a cell that can handle new materials or a substitute for the cell that can create a replicating nano environment for the production to take place in.  
<br>
<br>
I think the former is more practical in the short term.  Since DNA is a code much like the 1s and 0s of computer code, I think we can learn to manipulate it to produce just about anything we desire.  We should be able to build structures as big as a redwood or robots as small as a virus.  Nature has already developed the technology for us.  All was have to do now is learn how to use it.</p></td>

DNA forms building block for next breed of computer
<br>
<br>
<br>
By Jonathan Sidener 
<br>
STAFF WRITER 
<br>
<br>
September 1, 2003 
<br>
<br>
For years, researchers have taken advantage of the ever-increasing power of computers to crack the genetic code.
<br>
<br>
But Scripps Research Institute chemist Ehud Keinan and a handful of scientists around the world are going in the opposite direction, using DNA ' the blueprint for cellular life ' to crunch numbers inside a new breed of computer.
<br>
<br>
If the research is successful, children one day might operate a computer powered not by silicon chips, but by "biochips" that run software and store data using the same double-helix of DNA that determines whether our eyes are blue or peas are green.
<br>
<br>
And it is conceivable that future generations may have microscopic DNA computers coursing through their veins, capable of diagnosing and perhaps treating a variety of ills at the molecular level.
<br>
<br>
"You can't compare and say a DNA computer is or isn't faster than this," Keinan said, gesturing toward a sleek, metallic Macintosh PowerBook in his Scripps office. "It's a different type of computer."
<br>
<br>
DNA computers don't have keyboards and monitors. The computing takes place on the laboratory bench as complex molecular-chemical reactions.
<br>
<br>
The first calculations, nearly 10 years ago, took place inside beakers and test tubes.
<br>
<br>
A new generation of DNA computing uses biochips, devices built using semiconductor manufacturing technology. A biochip has millions of pieces of DNA on its surface instead of the millions of electronic circuits on a computer chip.
<br>
<br>
At the moment, DNA computers are laboratory curiosities. One computer can play a respectable game of tick-tack-toe. Another can solve chess riddles. The computations they handle would make the least powerful of today's computers yawn.
<br>
<br>
But DNA computers show some intriguing qualities.
<br>
<br>
DNA is extremely efficient, both in storing data and in its use of energy. One gram of DNA, which would take up about as much space as an ice cube, can hold as much information as 1 trillion compact discs.
<br>
<br>
With today's computer chips, energy consumption and the heat produced as a byproduct can cause malfunctions. But the chemical reactions that make a DNA computer work require little energy.
<br>
<br>
Most significantly, the biomolecular computers operate on different underlying principles.
<br>
<br>
Electronic computers make their calculations by processing a series of zeroes and ones, or binary code, one character at a time in a rapid sequence, like a machine gun that fires a series of bullets from a single barrel in succession.
<br>
<br>
Not so with DNA computers. Because millions of DNA snippets can fit into a drop of water, DNA computers can make many parallel calculations at once, more comparable to a shrapnel grenade that launches many projectiles at the same instant.
<br>
<br>
To Keinan and other researchers, this parallel processing provides much of the allure of DNA computing, the idea that machines built with a fundamentally different computing engine will be able to tackle fundamentally different questions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
A young science
<br>
DNA computing was born in 1994 when University of Southern California researcher Leonard Adleman devised a way to solve a mathematical brain teaser using fragments of DNA.
<br>
Several research teams around the globe have taken different approaches to this computing via biology, and it remains unclear which approach, if any, will emerge from the laboratory.
<br>
<br>
Electronic computers read a language consisting of two characters, 0 and 1. DNA computers read a language of four characters, the four molecules that make up DNA, known by their initials A, T, G and C.
<br>
<br>
Like its electronic brother, a DNA computer has software and hardware. The software is the DNA string. The hardware consists of enzymes that "read" the DNA strand and snip it at precise, known locations.
<br>
<br>
After each enzyme snip, four unbonded molecules remain at the end of the DNA snippet. DNA does not like to have unbonded molecules, so a second enzyme repairs the strand according to a set of rules hard-wired into DNA's biology.
<br>
<br>
DNA computers use the predictability of these repairs to perform their calculations.
<br>
<br>
The enzymes make a series of snips. At the final snip, the four letters of the unbonded molecules provide the answer or output of the calculation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
'Language of biology'
<br>
Keinan is part of a team from the Technion, Israel's Institute of Technology, that built the first autonomous DNA computer.
<br>
In addition to his work at Scripps, Keinan is the founder and head of the Institute of Catalysis Science and Technology at the Technion.
<br>
<br>
Before the Technion's work, molecular computers had required human guidance through a series of chemical reactions.
<br>
<br>
Keinan, an organic chemist who drifted into bio-molecular computing after a chance meeting with another Israeli researcher, won't guarantee that DNA computers will ever get beyond the laboratory.
<br>
<br>
"Maybe in 10, 20, 30 years, maybe not at all," he said. "The parameters are so attractive that I believe something wonderful will come out of this. But it would be foolish to make a prediction."
<br>
<br>
Pavel Pevzner, a computer science and engineering professor at the University of California San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, agrees that it is too early to divine the future of DNA computers.
<br>
<br>
"The problem is how to prove that this is not just an intellectual game," Pevzner said.
<br>
<br>
So far, researchers are missing a breakthrough, he said.
<br>
<br>
"They have not found a problem DNA computers can solve that cannot be solved with conventional computers. They need that killer application if they're going to be taken seriously."
<br>
<br>
Keinan and his colleagues in Israel are about to publish the results of research in which the output from a calculation turns on or off the pigment gene in a colony of bacteria.
<br>
<br>
The answer "Yes" might produce a beaker full of blue bacteria, while "No" would produce a colorless fluid.
<br>
<br>
While this is a simple example, it is a first step toward devices that can interact with biology.
<br>
<br>
DNA researchers hope that one day DNA computers will deliver drugs or repair cells from inside the bloodstream.
<br>
<br>
"DNA computers talk molecules, which is the language of biology, and therefore they can talk directly to cells and tell them what to do," Keinan said.
<br>
<br>
"It is true that DNA computers still lag behind silicon computers. Nevertheless, even today, DNA devices have already been able to do things in my lab, and go to places, that silicon computers cannot."

It also cannot provide the strong positioning control needed for flexible nanomachine design and assembly. For example, DNA would not be very good at making things out of diamondoid, a very desirable nanomaterial. That said, it probably has numerous applications in nanomedicine and other 'wet' environments. But most of all, DNA is slow compared to nanoassemblers capable of 10^6 operations per second. </p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It seems to me you can assemble something in a wet environment that is able to work in a dry environment.  Take people for example.  Sure, we start out in a wet environment, but once we leave the womb, the growth process continues in an externally dry environment.  In other words, such products can be wet on the inside and dry on the outside.  Look what shellfish are capable of making with DNA instructions.  Wet shellfish can make a dry shell of incredible complexity.
<br>
<br>
Anther consideration is that carbon, which diamonds are composed of, is manipulated by DNA and protiens on an atom-by-atom basis.  Placing carbon atoms precisely is one of the things DNA does best.  Without the precise manipulation of carbon atoms, the double helix would not exist.
<br>
<br>
I foresee a time when DNA will enable us to manufacture sheets of nanotubes.  A single cell containing DNA may be slow but when you have them multiplying exponentially, the final result can come about rather quickly.  Besides, it's not the DNA itself that does the manufacturing of things like skin, bones, liver and brain -- it's the proteins built by DNA working with RNA that do the manufacturing.  
<br>
<br>
Who knows what kinds of proteins we'll be able to create with the models provided by nature to guide our efforts?  That's where bioengineering will come into it's own -- using DNA code to set up and run the self-assembly process.  A protein is, after all, a type of manufacturing machine.  The sum total of all possible proteins is roughly equal to the total of all possible words in all the languages on Earth.  Most of the possibilities haven't even been explored yet.
