<p><i>Published on KurzweilAI.net Sept. 23, 2003. See also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743/http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html" target="_blank">The

              Moore, and Accelerating Change</a> (pdf) by Ilkka Tuomi.</i></p>
<p>In his detailed analysis "The Lives and <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> of <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a>," 
              Ilkka Tuomi concludes that the "<a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> industry has not actually 
              followed an <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_growth_entry.html">exponential growth</a> trend" and "price decreases have 
              not followed an <a class="thought" href="entries/exponential_trend_entry.html">exponential trend</a>."<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Tuomi's conclusions are surprising, to say the least.&#160; If correct, 
              I would have to conclude that the one-quarter <a class="thought" href="entries/mips_entry.html">MIPS</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> costing 
              several million dollars that I used at MIT in 1967 and the 1000 
              MIPS computer that I purchased recently for $2,000 never really 
              existed.&#160; Tuomi has an explanation for all this.&#160; He writes that 
              "the apparent explosive big bang in semiconductor <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is 
              . . . an illusion."<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"><sup>2</sup></a>&#160; </p>
<p>If all of this is an illusion, it has been quite an effective one.&#160; 
              The <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that Tuomi's conclusions defy <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> and clear 
              observation.&#160; They are at odds with the historical <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> on the past, 
              as well as all of the industry road maps for the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi's approach is to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up a variety of straw men in the form 
              of faulty interpretations of Moore's Law and then proceed to show 
              how certain data fail to match these incorrect interpretations.&#160; 
              When presented with a "forest" of data representing a clear exponential 
              trend, Tuomi often cites a tree with a missing branch (see my discussion 
              below on Tuomi's critique on my <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of the computing trend over 
              the past century).&#160; Tuomi supports his contrarian <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>ions with 
              a list of often conflicting technical terminology and irrelevant 
              historical anecdotes.&#160; There are a variety of misconceptions in 
              Tuomi's two papers, which I detail in this response essay.&#160; </p>
<p>Despite a plethora of misconstructions in the data that Tuomi presents, 
              his analysis is nonetheless replete with exponential trends.&#160; Tuomi's 
              remarkable conclusion that the semiconductor industry has not followed 
              an exponential trend is not consistent with his own analysis.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi repeatedly points out how the advances have not followed 
              the oft-quoted 18-month doubling <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> of Moore's Law.&#160; Tuomi is 
              correct that the 18-month figure is a mischaracterization.&#160; Moore 
              never said it, and it does not necessarily match the data (depending, 
              of course, on what you're measuring).&#160; Tuomi devotes a lot of his 
              paper to showing how the 18-month figure is not correct, at least 
              for certain measurements.&#160; He quotes a lot of people, such as R.X. 
              Cringely in 1992, who have gotten it wrong<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>But the fact that many people state Moore's Law incorrectly does 
              not mean that there is not a correct way to state it, and it certainly 
              does not follow that there has not been exponential growth.&#160; </p>
<p>Moore's Law refers to the continual shrinking of the size of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s 
              on an <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a>, as well as other process and design improvements.&#160; 
              This shrinking increases the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of transistors that can be placed 
              on a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, as well as their speed, resulting in dramatic exponential 
              gains in the <a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s. </p>
<p>My law of acceleration returns is broader, and refers to ongoing 
              exponential improvements in the price-performance and <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> technologies in general, of which Moore's law is just 
              one example.&#160; I provide further explanation and examples below.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Tuomi writes that </p>
<blockquote>"During the four decades of validity often claimed for 
              Moore's Law the difference between one-year and three-year doubling 
              time means about eight orders of magnitude. In other words, to get 
              the same number of transistors, the slower <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> path would require 
              us to buy 100 million chips, instead of one."<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><sup>4</sup></a>&#160; </blockquote>
<p>I would certainly agree that there is an enormous difference in 
              implications between a one-year and a three-year doubling time.&#160; 
              However, there is no such variability in the data, unless one is 
              trying to create confusion.&#160; Whether one gets a 36-month doubling 
              time or a 12-month doubling time, or any other doubling time, depends 
              entirely on what is being measured.&#160; If measuring something simple 
              like two-dimensional feature size, then the doubling time (toward 
              smaller features) is about 36 months.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#160; 
            </p>
<p>This has nothing to do, however, with cost-effectiveness or price-performance, 
              which is what we really care about.&#160; The cost per transistor has 
              fallen by half about every 1.6 years.&#160; If one takes into consideration 
              all of the levels of improvement including speed, as I describe 
              below, then the doubling time for price-performance is closer to 
              one year.&#160; </p>
<p>Regardless of the doubling time, the trends are all exponential, 
              not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>, both in the historical data, and in the roadmaps for 
              the future.&#160; Tuomi's point about the difference between 36 months 
              and 12 months as a doubling time is based entirely on comparing 
              apples to watermelons, or in this case, <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> sizes to actual price-performance 
              improvements.&#160; </p>
<p>Let's examine these issues in more detail.&#160; I'll start with my 
              own four-plus decades of <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in this industry.&#160; Compare the 
              MIT computer I mentioned above to my current notebook.&#160; As a student 
              in 1967, I had <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to a multi-million dollar <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> 7094 with 32K 
              (36-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>) words of <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and a quarter of a MIPS processor speed.&#160; 
              I now use a $2,000 <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">personal computer</a> with a quarter billion bytes 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/ram_entry.html">RAM</a> and about a thousand MIPS processor speed.&#160; The MIT computer 
              was about a thousand times more expensive, so the comparison with 
              regard to the cost per MIPS is a factor of about 4 million to one.&#160;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="javascript:openImage('images/TuomiTable1.jpg',600,242)"><img border="0" height="151" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/TuomiTable1Small.jpg" width="375"></a>

<p>This ignores many other advantages of my contemporary computer.&#160; 
              Ignoring these other significant factors of improvement, the contemporary 
              computer provides MIPS of processing at a cost that is 2<sup>22</sup> 
              lower than the computer I used in 1967.&#160; That's 22 doublings in 
              36 years, or about 19 months per doubling.&#160; If we factor in the 
              increased value of the approximately 2,000 fold greater RAM memory, 
              vast increases in disk storage, the more powerful instruction set 
              of my circa 2003 computer, vast improvements in <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> speeds, 
              more powerful <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, and other factors, the doubling time comes 
              down even further.&#160; </p>
<p>Consider <a class="thought" href="entries/microprocessor_entry.html">microprocessor</a> history.&#160; The Intel 8080 had 5,000 transistors 
              in 1974.&#160; The Pentium IV had 42 million transistors in 2000.&#160; That's 
              just about exactly 13 doublings in 26 years, which is a two-year 
              doubling time.&#160; Keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> that this two-year doubling time takes 
              into consideration only this single factor of the number of transistors.&#160; 
              If we also factor in the fact that the smaller Pentium IV transistors 
              operate many times faster and are organized with many layers of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> innovation, then the overall price-performance improvement 
              is greater than 2<sup>13</sup>.&#160; The graph (of number of transistors) 
              of the intervening processors (such as 8086, 286, 386, 486, Pentium, 
              Pentium 2, etc.) shows smooth exponential growth (R<sup>2</sup> 
              = 0.9873).<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><sup>6</sup></a>&#160; </p>
<p align="center"><a href="javascript:openImage('images/numtransistorslog.jpg',800,550)"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/numtransistorslogsmall.jpg" width="400"><br>
</a><span class="Caption">Click for larger version</span></p>
<p>We should also keep in mind that adding transistors to a microprocessor 
              is not the sole or even the primary goal of semiconductor technology.&#160; 
              At a certain point in the future, we will have the optimal <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> 
              for a single processor.&#160; We will continue to want to improve price-performance, 
              but not necessarily number of transistors in a single microprocessor.&#160; 
              Thus the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) 
              projects the number of transistors in a single microprocessor to 
              double every 36 months through 2016, but also projects the cost 
              of a single microprocessor to come down such that the cost per transistor 
              in a microprocessor is coming down by half every 24 months.&#160; Even 
              this figure ignores the speed improvement factor, which I discuss 
              below.&#160; </p>
<p>Data from Dataquest and Intel shows that the average price of a 
              transistor per year went from 1 dollar in 1968 to about 2 x 10<sup>-7</sup> 
              dollars in 2002.&#160; That represents an improvement of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> 
              (= approximately 2<sup>22</sup>) in 34 years.&#160; This represents 22 
              doublings in 34 years, or about 1.6 years per doubling.&#160; Again, 
              the trend has been very smooth in intervening years.<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><sup>7</sup></a>&#160; 
            </p>
<p align="center"> <a href="javascript:openImage('images/transistorpricelog.jpg',800,550)"><img border="0" height="254" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/transistorpricelogsmall.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

<p>Keep in mind that unlike Gertrude Stein's roses, it is not the 
              case that a transistor is a transistor.&#160; Because transistors have 
              been getting steadily smaller (at an exponential rate), they have 
              been getting faster, so this factor brings down the doubling time 
              for price-performance even further.&#160; And there are other levels 
              of innovation that also improve price-performance.</p>
<p>The available data also supports exponential growth in volumes.&#160; 
              The number of transistors shipped, according to Instat/MDR, went 
              from 2 x 10<sup>9</sup> in 1968 to just under 10<sup>18</sup> in 
              2002, or an increase of about 4 x 10<sup>8</sup> (= 2<sup>29</sup>) 
              in 34 years.&#160; This represents a doubling time of 1.1 years.<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><sup>8</sup></a>&#160; Again, this ignores other levels of improvement.&#160; 
            </p>
<p align="center"><a href="javascript:openImage('images/totalbitsshippedlog.jpg',800,550)"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/totalbitsshippedlogsmall.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

<p>Now let's factor in the speed improvement.&#160; Interestingly, Tuomi 
              provides us with this exponential trend in his paper<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref9"><sup>9</sup></a>:</p>

<p align="left">It is difficult to see the exponential trend in Tuomi's

<p>With a speed improvement of approximately 10<sup>3</sup> in 34 
              years (1968 to 2002), the cost per transistor cycle decreased by 
              a factor of 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> (= 2<sup>32</sup>), resulting in 
              a doubling time of just over 12 months.<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"><sup>11</sup></a>&#160; 
              Even this analysis takes into consideration only semiconductor density 
              and process improvements, and does not take into consideration improvements

<p>The theoretical total number of transistor cycles in the world 
              increased by a factor of 4 x 10<sup>11</sup> (= 2<sup>39</sup>) 
              in 34 years, resulting in a doubling time of only 10.4 months. </p>
<p>One could go on for many pages with such analyses, measuring many 
              different dependent measures, and citing data from many sources, 
              all of which show clear exponential growth.&#160; Tuomi's myopic finding 
              that there is no exponential growth in the semiconductor industry 
              is notable, and I admire his tenacity in attempting to prove that 
              the world of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a> is flat (i.e., linear).&#160; </p>
<p>One <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> technology improves exponentially is that we seek to 
              improve quantifiable measures by multiples rather than by linear 
              increments.&#160; About a half century ago, Dr. An Wang and his <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers 
              struggled to add an increment of a thousand bits to his (iron-core-based) 
              RAM storage.&#160; Do engineers struggle to add a thousand bits to a 
              memory design today?&#160; Or a million bits?&#160; Design goals today are 
              more likely to be measured in billions of bits.&#160; Goals are always 
              set in a multiplicative relation to the current standard.&#160; </p>
<p>Another reason that technology improves exponentially is that we 
              use the (more) powerful tools of one generation of technology to 
              create the next.&#160; Early computers were designed pen-on-paper and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> with <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> wires and screwdrivers.&#160; Today, a chip or 
              computer designer specifies formulae and high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s in 
              a high-level <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>, and many layers of intermediate design are 
              automatically computed by powerful computer-assisted-design software 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.&#160; </p>
<p>For these and related reasons, we see exponential growth not only 
              in memory and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>al price-performance, but across the board 
              in information-related technologies.&#160; For over two decades, I have 
              been studying key measures of capacity and price-performance in 
              a wide variety of such technologies.&#160; The data clearly shows exponential 
              growth that goes far beyond Moore's Law or computation.&#160; We see 
              exponential growth in a broad variety of measures of the capacity 
              and price-performance of information technologies.&#160; To provide just 
              a few examples, consider the price-performance of magnetic-disk 
              memory density, which is a <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a> distinct from semiconductors<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><sup>12</sup></a>:

<p>We also see exponential growth in varied measures of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, 
              and even in the key feature sizes of technology, both electronic 
              and mechanical.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref16"><sup>16</sup></a>&#160; 
              Tuomi himself adds to our extensive list of examples of exponential 
              growth in information when he writes, "According to Price (1986), 
              the number of scientific journals has doubled about every 15 years 
              since 1750, the number of '<a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant discoveries' has doubled every 
              20 years, and the number of U.S. engineers about every 10 years."<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>I do agree, however, that for many applications, exponential growth 
              of a capability (such as memory size or processor speed) does not 
              necessarily translate into exponential growth in <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a>.&#160; For many 
              functions, it requires exponential growth in capability to obtain 
              linear gains in functionality.&#160; It requires, for example, exponential 
              gains in computing to obtain linear gains in <a class="thought" href="entries/chess_entry.html">chess</a> ratings.&#160; Similarly, 
              we see linear gains in the accuracy of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s 
              (for example, speech recognition) with exponential gains in processor 
              speed and memory capacity.&#160; However, for inherently exponential 
              problems, linear gains in functionality and performance are very 
              powerful and sufficient to obtain profound benefits.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi writes that "Exponential growth . . . is very uncommon in 
              real world [sic]. It usually ends when it starts to <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>."<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"><sup>18</sup></a>&#160; 
              It is clear, however, that the information industry (in all of its 
              manifestations) has indeed begun to matter.&#160; Moreover, Tuomi provides 
              no basis to conclude that exponential growth in computing has ended 
              or is about to end.&#160; </p>
<p>When we are unable to continue to shrink two-dimensional integrated 
              circuits, we will build three-dimensional circuits.&#160; Note that this 
              will not be the first <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_shift_entry.html">paradigm shift</a> in computing because Moore's 
              Law itself represented not the first but the fifth <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a> to provide 
              exponential growth to computing.&#160; Prior to flat integrated circuits, 
              we had electro-mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/calculator_entry.html">calculator</a>s, relay-based computing <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_entry.html">vacuum</a> 
              tubes, and then discrete transistors.&#160; Even though the semiconductor 
              industry road map<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"><sup>19</sup></a> 
              indicates that we have more than a dozen years left to obtain exponential 
              growth through two-dimensional circuits, there has been enormous 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in recent years in developing early prototypes of three-dimensional 
              circuits.&#160; </p>
<p>Based on our current understanding of the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> of computing, 
              the inherent limits to exponential growth of computation and communication 
              are extremely high (that is, the minimum matter and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> required 
              to compute a bit or transmit a bit is extremely low).<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20"><sup>20</sup></a>&#160; 
              One of the most promising is to create general-purpose electronics 
              using <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, which are hexagonal arrays of <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> atoms. This 
              approach has shown considerable promise in <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s.&#160; When fully 
              developed, nanotube-based circuitry has the potential to be many 
              orders of magnitude more powerful than flat integrated circuits.&#160; 
              Even nanotubes do not approach the fundamental limits of computing, 
              based on our current understanding of the physics of computation.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>In Tuomi's review of the industry's history, he notes that on several 
              occasions the industry just happened to be "saved" by special circumstances, 
              for example, the emergence of the calculator and memory chip markets 
              in 1965-68.<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"><sup>21</sup></a>&#160; Tuomi assumes that the industry was just lucky 
              that the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of these two product categories came at the right 
              time.&#160; He writes that in general, "semiconductor technology has 
              evolved during the last four decades under very special economic 
              conditions."<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22"><sup>22</sup></a>&#160; 
            </p>
<p>But the introduction of new product categories made feasible by 
              the greater price-performance of each new generation of semiconductor 
              technology is inherently part of the process.&#160; More powerful chips, 
              which have been occurring on a very predictable basis, lead to new 
              product categories, which in turn lead to greater volumes.&#160; </p>
<p>The pace of this type of innovation has increased in recent years 
              with the rapid introduction of new types of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> products.&#160; An 
              inherent aspect of progress in information-based technologies is 
              new paradigms on every level.&#160; Often, old problems are not solved 
              directly, but rather are circumvented by the introduction of new 
              paradigms, new applications, and new markets. But to Tuomi, the 
              50 years of exponential growth attributable to integrated chips 
              (preceded by 50 years of exponential growth from pre-chip technologies) 
              is all a temporary aberration.&#160; </p>
<p>It is important to point out that an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process &#150; whether 
              of technology or <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>&#160; &#150; is always a matter of special circumstances.&#160; 
              However, there are always special circumstances.&#160; Whatever it was 
              that hit the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> that resulted in the demise of the dinosaurs 
              was a special circumstance, one that had profound implications for 
              all <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> at that time.&#160; But the progression of biological evolution 
              was not dependent on that <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> just happening.&#160; In general, evolutionary 
              events happen in "special" ecological niches that are inherently 
              delicate and bounded by distinctive circumstances.&#160; </p>
<p>The "special circumstances" that Tuomi refers to in the semiconductor 
              industry have kept Moore's Law going for half a century, and counting.&#160; 
              The acceleration of the price-performance of computation goes back 
              at least a century.&#160; Special circumstances are part of the evolutionary 
              process &#150; not a reason to overlook its exponential progression.&#160; 
              As Gilda Radner used to say on Saturday Night Live, "it's always 
              something" &#150; meaning there is always something special about current 
              circumstances.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi's analysis is filled with strained analyses that stretch 
              the data to make his contrarian points.&#160; </p>
<p>Consider his hand-drawn trend lines on the following graph<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23"><sup>23</sup></a>:</p>
<p align="center"><img height="208" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/tuominumtransistors.jpg" width="400"><br>
<span class="Caption">Tuomi's Figure 3: Number of transistors on 
              Intel microprocessors</span></p>
<p>Tuomi has drawn his chart in a misleading way.&#160; For example, it 
              suddenly jumps up at year 21, yet this improvement is not taken 
              into consideration.&#160; There are only two outlier points, both around 
              years 20 and 21 (the "x" below the right point of the middle line, 
              and the left most point of the right most line).&#160; If one draws a 
              trend line through all of the points, leaving out these two outliers 
              (which, in any event, cancel each other out), one gets a relatively 
              smooth exponential chart. &#160;See my previous chart on the number of 
              transistors in Intel microprocessors.&#160; Note that both Tuomi's and 
              my chart leave out the issue of transistor speed and the effect 
              of many design innovations.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi includes less powerful processors at various points in time 
              that skew the curve.&#160; There are always less-powerful versions of 
              processors offered for special markets.&#160; The appropriate microprocessor 
              to include at each point in time is the one providing the optimal 
              performance.&#160; It is also worth pointing out that the number of transistors 
              in a microprocessor is not the most relevant variable to measure.&#160; 
              We are more concerned with the functionality per unit cost.&#160; </p>
<p>As noted previously, at some point, there will be an optimal number 
              of transistors to perform the functions of a single processor.&#160; 
              At that point, we won't be interested in increasing the number of 
              transistors in a microprocessor, but we will continue to be interested 
              in improving price-performance.&#160; Above, I provided a properly constructed 
              chart on transistors in Intel processors.&#160; </p>
<p>If we measure what is really important (overall processor performance), 
              we need to consider speed improvements, among other factors.&#160; Tuomi 
              himself provides evidence of the exponential speed improvement in 
              his figure 4 above.&#160; Taking speed as well as design innovations 
              into account, we get a doubling time of about 1.8 years for overall 
              processor performance.<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24"><sup>24</sup></a>&#160; This does not include the issue of word length, 
              which has been increasing during this period.&#160; Including this factor 
              would bring down the doubling time further.&#160; </p>

<p><b>&#160;</b>Remarkably, Tuomi prints a similar chart and concludes

<p>His hand-drawn trend lines (on a logarithmic chart) show exponential 
              growth, with the trend lines jumping up (meaning increased values) 
              at two points.&#160; Each straight line on Tuomi's logarithmic chart 
              is an exponential, but as one goes across the chart (from left to

              not explained.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi cites the following chart<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26"><sup>26</sup></a> 
              to make a point about the <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> cycle of a particular generation 
              of chip:</p>
<p align="center"><img height="230" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/tuomipricequant.jpg" width="400"><br>

              Quantities of 16-kilobit DRAM chips. Source: Grimm, 1998</span></p>
<p>Tuomi makes the point that one can obtain misleading trends by 
              taking price points at different times in the life cycles of different 
              chips.&#160; But this criticism is not valid for any of the charts I 
              have presented, nor those cited from other industry sources.&#160; The 
              chart that I provided above for average cost per transistor is exactly 
              that &#150; the average cost for that year.&#160; In charts involving different 
              types of chips, prices at the point of production are consistently 
              used.&#160; There has been no attempt to compare one point in the life 
              cycle of one chip to a different point in the life cycle of another 
              chip.&#160; </p>
<p>However, let's take a look at what happens if we examine the entire 
              life cycle of multiple generations of semiconductor technology<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27"><sup>27</sup></a>:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="javascript:openImage('images/transcostlog.jpg',800,550)"><img border="0" height="251" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/transcostlogsmall.jpg" width="400"></a><br>

<p>In this logarithmic chart, we can see the life cycle of each generation, 
              and the overall exponential trend in the improvement of price-performance 
              remains clearly evident.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi spends a lot of time in both papers talking about the "hedonic" 
              model for economic value of various features and "quality" improvements 
              such as increased memory or increased speed.&#160; He writes:</p>
<blockquote><i>&#160;"&#133;if a 100 MHz PC costs today 500 dollars 
              more than a 60 MHz PC, we might assume that if a 100 MHz PC costs 
              today as much as a 60 MHz PC a year ago, technical advance has been

<p>The hedonic model has little validity.&#160; Current software may only 
              make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> for the mainstream specifications, so purchasers would 
              not be willing to pay very much for more memory than they need for 
              the applications they have or intend to use.&#160; However, at a later 
              time, when the more sophisticated applications available require 
              more memory, they would be willing to pay for this extra memory, 
              and in fact would not want the computer if it didn't provide the 
              memory (or other capabilities) necessary to run these applications.&#160; 
              Furthermore, certain variations in specifications may appeal only 
              to small niche markets.&#160; All of these factors distort this hedonic 
              model <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology.&#160; </p>
<p>However, despite these methodological concerns, Tuomi himself cites 
              numerous examples of exponential growth in price-performance based 
              on quality-adjusted prices.&#160; He writes: </p>
<blockquote><i>"The classic study of quality corrected prices in computing 
              is by Chow (1967), who analyzed <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> rental prices in the 1960s. 
              According to Chow, quality-adjusted prices fell at an average annual 
              growth rate (AAGR) of about -21 percent during the 1960-1965 period. 
              Cole et al. (1986) studied the price declines of different computer 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s and found that over the 1972-1984 period, the AAGR for 
              computer processors was -19.2 percent using the hedonic prices. 
              . . .Cartwright (1986), in turn, reported an AAGR of -13.8 percent 
              from 1972 to 1984. According to Gordon (1989), quality adjusted 
              mainframe prices fell 22 percent annually from 1951 to 1984."</i><a href="#_edn29" name="_ednref29"><i><sup>29</sup></i></a><i>&#160; 
              </i></blockquote>
<p>These are all exponential improvements cited by Tuomi.&#160; It should 
              also be noted that during this time frame, mainframes started out 
              as the best value, but were no longer remotely close to the best 
              value by the end of the time period.&#160; Mainframes maintained artificially 
              high prices to locked-in customers (who eventually escaped the lock-in 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/minicomputer_entry.html">minicomputer</a>s and then personal computers).&#160; Nonetheless, even 
              just considering mainframes, and an insufficient "quality adjustment" 
              methodology, it still shows exponential improvement in price-performance. 
              Tuomi continues: </p>
<p>
<i>
<blockquote><i>"Triplett (1989) summarized earlier hedonic studies 
              on mainframe computer prices and reported a 'best-practice' quality-adjusted 
              price decline of -27 percent over the 1953-1972 time period. Gordon 
              (1990) then extended his earlier analysis to personal computers 
              and reported 30 percent annual declines from 1981 to 1987. Berndt 
              and Griliches (1990) collected a large sample of data on personal 
              computers and reported 28 percent annual decreases from 1982 to 
              1988."</i></blockquote>
</i>
<p></p>
<p>Note that a 30% decline each year = 51% decline (i.e., doubling 
              of price-performance) in 2 years.&#160; 28% each year = 48.2% decline 
              in 2 years, all examples of exponential growth.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi provides even further evidence of exponential improvement: 
            </p>
<p>
<blockquote>"<i>Grimm has also calculated price indexes for microprocessors 
              using the same methodology. For microprocessors the decline in price 
              indexes has been considerably faster than for memory chips. During 
              the 1985-1996 period, quality adjusted microprocessor prices dropped 
              at an average annual rate of 35 percent."</i></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Note that an annual improvement of 35 percent is a doubling time 
              (of price-performance) of less than 24 months.&#160; Also, the quality 
              adjustment methodology, as I noted earlier, understates the values 
              for the reasons I cited above. Tuomi's conclusion is again to state 
              the "the price decreases have not followed an exponential trend."&#160; 
              This conclusion is not consistent with the evidence that Tuomi provides 
              in his own papers.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi consistently miscalculates these doubling times. For example, 
              he writes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><i>"on average prices per unit of memory have declined 
              32 percent per year during the 1978 &#150; 2000 period.&#160; This corresponds 
              to a 30 month doubling time."</i><a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30"><i><sup>30</sup></i></a><i>&#160; 
              </i></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><i> </i>If prices drop 32 percent in one year, a price of $1 would 
              be $0.68 after one year and $0.46 after two years (i.e., falling 
              to less than half in 24 months).&#160; A 32 percent decline in price 
              per year corresponds to a doubling time of under 22 months, not 
              30 months.&#160; He makes this mistake repeatedly, so Tuomi's stated 
              doubling times cannot be relied upon.&#160; Regardless of whether the 
              doubling time is calculated correctly or not, this is one of many 
              pieces of evidence cited by Tuomi himself of exponential improvement.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>In Tuomi's paper on my <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">law of accelerating returns</a>, "Kurzweil, 
              Moore, and Accelerating Change<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31"><sup>31</sup></a>," 
              he describes my thesis as leading "to an apparently infinite speed 
              of change."&#160; I do want to clarify that exponential growth, even 
              double exponential growth, does not lead to infinite rates of change.&#160; 
              It nonetheless will lead to greatly transforming rates of change.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, Tuomi cites Moore's change in description of what has 
              become known as Moore's Law from his 1965 paper, in which he cited 
              a doubling time of transistors per dollar of one year, to his revised 
              estimate in 1975 of two years.&#160; Tuomi describes this as Moore noting 
              "that the speed of technical change was slowing down."&#160; This is 
              a mischaracterization.&#160; Moore simply corrected his earlier estimate 
              to a more accurate one (one that has, incidentally, been conservative).&#160; 
              He was not saying that it had been one year and was now becoming 
              two years.&#160; He was saying that his earlier one-year estimate had 
              been incorrect, and that it had been two years and would remain 
              so.&#160; </p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, when presented with the "forest" of a trend, 
              Tuomi often responds with a comment about a missing branch of a 
              tree.&#160; For example, in response to my chart on a century of double 
              exponential growth in computing:</p>
<p align="center"><img height="295" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/chart03.jpg" width="375"></p>
<p><b></b>Tuomi responds that "Ceruzzi (1998:71,74) gives $1.6 to 
              about $2 million as the price of a full IBM 7090 installation. Kurzweil 
              uses $3 million. Kurzweil has also moved Babbage's <a class="thought" href="entries/analytical_engine_entry.html">Analytical Engine</a> 
              about half a century in time, with the explanation that it probably 
              could have been built in 1900. Other authors have argued the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              could have been built using available manufacturing capabilities."&#160; 
            </p>
<p>I would argue with both of Tuomi's assertions, but even if one 
              removes these two points, it hardly makes a dent in this forest 
              of a trend.&#160; </p>
<p>My team of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers has been adding additional points to this 
              trend that corroborate this double-exponential trend.&#160; Note that 
              a straight line on a logarithmic graph represents exponential growth, 
              and that the exponential trend here is itself exponential &#150; it took 
              three years to double the price-performance of computing at the 
              beginning of the twentieth century, two years in the middle, and 
              it is now doubling approximately every one year.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/moravec_entry.html">Hans Moravec</a>'s analysis<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32"><sup>32</sup></a>, 
              which includes additional points from my own chart, also shows the 
              same double-exponential trend:</p>
<p align="center"><i><a href="javascript:openImage('images/moravecpowercost.jpg',600,487)"><img border="0" height="315" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100613235743im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/moravecpowercostsmall.jpg" width="400"><br>

<p>Tuomi also writes that "Historical data also reveals that the early 
              computers rarely were working at their theoretical speeds."&#160; This 
              point only strengthens the observation that later computers were 
              more powerful.&#160; </p>
<p>Perhaps the most convoluted argument that Tuomi presents is his 
              discussion of the alleged lack of increased resources to the semiconductor 
              industry.&#160; He writes "Technological developments in the semiconductor 
              industry are generally viewed as the drivers of progress in computing. 
              According to Kurzweil's <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a>, one would expect semiconductor 
              industry to enjoy increasing positive returns that would speed up 
              technical developments in the industry. Indeed, in Kurzweil's model, 
              the rapid technical developments would be caused by the increase 
              in resources available for developers."&#160; </p>
<p>Remarkably, Tuomi states that there have been no "accelerating 
              increases in its resources."&#160; Yet he cites a report from the World 
              Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) that "the average year-to-year 
              change in semiconductor shipment value during the 1958 &#150; 2002 period 
              is 18 percent."&#160; This, of course, is exponential growth, so how 
              does Tuomi justify his conclusion that I am incorrect in my assessment 
              that the computer and information industries (which includes the 
              semiconductor industry) have benefited from increased resources?</p>
<p>Tuomi provides this chart<a href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33"><sup>33</sup></a>:</p>

<p>He takes the growth rate of the semiconductor industry and subtracts 
              the growth rate of the U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/gdp_entry.html">GDP</a>.&#160; This is a dubious proposition 
              because the growth rate of the GDP is fueled specifically by technological 
              innovation, particularly in information technologies.&#160; So we are 
              subtracting from the growth rate of the semiconductor industry the 
              growth rate of the economy.&#160; Yet it is the semiconductor and information 
              technology industries that are primary contributors to the growth 
              of the economy.&#160; </p>
<p>The result is nonetheless positive, which Tuomi calculates as averaging 
              10.8 percent annual growth (over the GDP growth).&#160; However, he then 
              takes the derivative (slope) of this curve and notes that it is 
              negative.&#160; </p>
<p>From this, he concludes that the semiconductor industry has not 
              enjoyed increased resources.&#160; Yet, the industry has grown on average 
              by 18 percent according to Tuomi's own analysis, and this growth 
              rate exceeds that of the overall economy to which it contributes.&#160; 
              The appropriate conclusion of the negative slope in this complex 
              graph is that the growth rate of the economy is catching up to the 
              growth rate of the semiconductor industry.&#160; The reason for that 
              is that information technology in general is becoming increasingly 
              pervasive and influential.&#160; Information technology itself has gone 
              from 4.2% of the GDP in 1977 to 8.2% in 1998, with the growth rate 
              recently accelerating.<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>Moreover, information technology is increasingly influential on 
              all aspects of the economy.&#160; Even those industries that are not 
              explicitly "information technology" are nonetheless deeply influenced 
              by it.&#160; We are rapidly moving towards an era in which the dominant 
              portion of the value of most products is represented by their information 
              content.&#160; Thus the overall economy is slowly catching up to the 
              rapid growth rates of information-related industries such as the 
              semiconductor industry, specifically because of the effect of these 
              industries.&#160; </p>
<p>The bottom line is that resources have increased exponentially 
              in the information technology industries, including the semiconductor 
              industry, and this rate of growth is not slowing down.&#160; Moreover, 
              this is the less important part of the story.&#160; The more important 
              issue is not merely the increase in dollars, but the very rapid 
              exponential growth of what each dollar buys.&#160; </p>
<p>Both <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and software have increased enormously in power.&#160; 
              Today, a semiconductor engineer sits at a powerful computer assisted 
              design station and writes chip specifications in a high-level language.&#160; 
              Many layers of intermediate design, up to and including actual chip 
              layouts, are then computed automatically.&#160; Compare that to early 
              semiconductor designers who actually blocked out each cell with 
              ink on paper.&#160; Or compare that to the early computer designers who 
              wrote out their designs by pen and then built the computers with 
              individual components, wires and screwdrivers.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi cites the following graph to argue that computers and software 
              investments have not been growing exponentially<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35"><sup>35</sup></a>:</p>

<p>First of all, the data on figure 2 above matches a slow exponential 
              more closely than a straight line, which does not match very well.&#160; 
              The data starts under the line and ends up over the line.&#160; </p>
<p>More importantly, this graph is not plotting the actual computer 
              and software investments, but rather expressing them as a percentage 
              of private fixed investment, which is itself growing exponentially, 
              reflecting the growth of the IT sector as a percentage of the GDP.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Tuomi writes that ". . .an exponential trend defines a technical 
              trajectory that is independent of any external factors. Moore's 
              Law, in its original form, is basically such a claim. Its exponential 
              form implies that. . .developments in integrated circuits are effectively 
              independent of economic, organizational, social, or any other forces."<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36"><sup>36</sup></a>&#160; 
            </p>
<p>Tuomi here is misunderstanding the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of exponential growth 
              in information technology.&#160; The development of semiconductors and 
              related computer technologies is not taking place in a vacuum.&#160; 
              External factors are very much involved.&#160; This is a classical evolutionary 
              process taking place in a competitive environment.&#160; If there were 
              no economic value to increased capacities, they would not be developed.&#160; 
              Greater capacities and price-performance lead to new capabilities 
              and applications, which in turn result in increased demand. &#160;Moreover, 
              the more powerful tools from one generation of technology create 
              the next more powerful generation.&#160; </p>
<p>Tuomi's argument becomes particularly strained when he discusses 
              the purported benefits of <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> computing.&#160; He writes, "Many mathematical 
              problems that require an infinite number of algorithmic computations 
              can be solved by intelligent humans and by non-algorithmic calculating 
              machines. A classical technical method of doing this has been to 
              use analog computers. Indeed, in many classes of mathematical problems 
              the computational power of an analog computer is infinitely greater 
              than the computation power of conventional digital computers."&#160; 
            </p>
<p>The above statements are illogical.&#160; "Humans and non-algorithmic 
              calculating machines" are clearly not able to solve mathematical 
              problems that "require an infinite number of algorithmic computations."&#160; 
              Moreover, the use of an analog computer certainly does not allow 
              one to accomplish this.&#160; </p>
<p>It is also completely unjustified to say that an analog computer 
              "is infinitely greater than the computation power of conventional 
              digital computers."&#160; This conclusion derives from the na&#239;ve notion 
              that digital computers can only deal with "on" and "off," and not 
              with shades of gray in between.&#160; By using <a class="thought" href="entries/floating_point_entry.html">floating point number</a>s, 
              digital computers can represent fractional values to any desired 
              precision.&#160; In fact, digital computers are much more precise than 
              analog computers in doing this.&#160; </p>
<p>Prior to World War II, analog computers were popular, and digital 
              computers required the "digital" modifier to distinguish them.&#160; 
              But analog computers are so unpopular today that we no longer are 
              required to use the word "digital" before "computer."&#160; Although 
              an analog computer can represent a fractional value, the accuracy 
              of analog components is relatively low and unpredictable.&#160; With 
              a digital computer's floating point numbers, the accuracy is known 
              from the number of bits in the floating point representation.&#160; </p>
<p>If desired, one could use thousands of bits in each floating point 
              number (the algorithms for doing this are well understood), which 
              would provide accuracy far exceeding any conceivable analog process.&#160; 
              Of course, for most practical applications, 32-bit or 64-bit floating 
              point numbers are quite sufficient, and exceed the accuracy of existing 
              analog computers.&#160; </p>
<p>There is an engineering argument that for some applications, such 
              as precisely modeling the nonlinear aspects of human <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, using 
              transistors in their native analog mode is more efficient.&#160; California 
              Institute of Technology Professor <a class="thought" href="entries/mead_entry.html">Carver Mead</a> has pioneered this 
              approach to doing neuromorphic modeling.&#160; There are counter-arguments 
              to this: such analog chips are difficult to design and are not <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable.&#160; 
              But regardless of how one settles this particular design issue, 
              Tuomi's statements about analog computers appear to have no basis.&#160;

<p>In conclusion, every time I open the morning paper (which I now 
              usually read online) and look at the specifications and prices in

<p><b>Responses to Ilkka Tuomi's </b></p>
<p><b>"The Lives and Death of Moore's Law"</b><a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Technical considerations of optimal chip manufacturing 
              costs have been expanded to processor performance, <a class="thought" href="entries/economics_entry.html">economics</a> of 
              computing, and social development. It is therefore useful to review 
              the various interpretations of Moore's Law and empirical evidence 
              that could support them.</i></p>
<p><i>Such an analysis reveals that semiconductor technology has evolved 
              during the last four decades under very special economic conditions. 
              </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Every paradigm has special conditions.&#160; Evolutionary 
              change in either biology or technology always derives from finely 
              tuned conditions and operates at the edge of survival (of a species 
              or a product line).&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Several observers have . . . . speculated about the possibility 
              of "the end of Moore's Law." Often these speculations 
              have concluded by noting that Moore's Law will probably be valid 
              for at least "a few more generations of technology," or 
              about a decade. An important example is the International Technology 
              Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), which now extends to 2016. This 
              roadmap is generated by a global group of experts and represents 
              their consensus. . . . it notes that within the next 10-15 years 
              "most of the known technological capabilities will approach 
              or have reached their limits."</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: These well-publicized limits of Moore's Law pertain to 
              flat two-dimensional circuits only.&#160; Sometime during the second 
              decade of this century, key feature sizes will be a small number 
              of atoms in width, and we won't be able to shrink them further.&#160; 
              At these scales, these circuits are vastly more efficient than the 
              cumbersome electrochemical signaling used in <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>ian interneuronal 
              connections, but only in 2-D.&#160; We live in a three-dimensional world, 
              and it is clear that we will move into the third dimension.&#160; The 
              research accomplishments underlying three-dimensional molecular 
              computing are escalating rapidly, and are ahead of comparable points 
              in history prior to other paradigm shifts.&#160; The entire paradigm 
              of Moore's Law (flat integrated circuits) was not the first but 
              the fifth paradigm to provide exponential growth to computing &#150; 
              each time it became clear that a paradigm would end, research would 
              intensify on the next paradigm. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Speculations on the extended lifetime of Moore's Law 
              are therefore often centered on <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_computing_entry.html">quantum computing</a>, bio-computing, 
              DNA computers, and other theoretically possible information processing 
              mechanisms. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is the wrong list.&#160; Quantum computing, bio-computing 
              and DNA computers, if perfected, would be special-purpose <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s.&#160; 
              Although prodigious on certain classes of problems, they are not 
              suitable for general-purpose computing.&#160; Quantum computing can in 
              theory try every combination of qubit value simultaneously.&#160; So 
              for the class of problems in which a solution can be easily tested, 
              such as finding the factors of large numbers to break <a class="thought" href="entries/encryption_entry.html">encryption</a> 
              codes, it is a great technology.&#160; But it provides no speed improvement 
              for most conventional computing problems.&#160; The primary focus for 
              the sixth paradigm of computing (after electromechanical, relay-based, 
              vacuum-tubes, discrete transistors, and integrated circuits) is 
              three-dimensional molecular computing.&#160; I have always favored nanotube-based 
              designs, and these in fact have obtained the most advances in recent 
              research.&#160;</p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The fundamental assumption was that the total manufacturing 
              costs are practically independent of the complexity of the chips. 
              For this to be the case, the engineering and design costs had to 
              be so small that they could be neglected. Indeed, Moore noted that 
              the costs of integrated circuits were totally dominated by packaging 
              costs. In other words, the costs of <a class="thought" href="entries/silicon_entry.html">silicon</a> was fixed and knowledge 
              was free and the only limiting factor in manufacturing costs was 
              the rapidly increasing waste created by deteriorating yields. Moore's 
              discussion did not explicitly take into account investment costs. 
              </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: It is true that engineering of each new generation of 
              chips has become more complex, but there have been countervailing 
              trends that more than offset this.&#160; First, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_aided_design_entry.html">CAD</a> sophistication (and 
              the computers to run CAD software on) has substantially increased, 
              allowing increasingly sophisticated chips to be developed in comparable 
              time frames.&#160; Also, the number of chips produced in each generation 
              has increased at an exponential rate, allowing development costs 
              to be amortized over an increasingly large volume.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: From an economic point of view, Moore's Law was a rather 
              fascinating law. It implied that the development of integrated circuits 
              was completely determined by manufacturing costs. Moore's Law, therefore, 
              defines a completely new economy. In this economy, demand is infinite.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Infinite?&#160; This is clearly an oversimplification.&#160; Nonetheless, 
              demand has kept pace with continued exponential gains in memory 
              size and computer capabilities, as evidenced by the exponential 
              growth of the semiconductor industry (which Tuomi himself describes 
              as being 18 percent per year) and the overall information technology 
              industry.&#160; Below, Tuomi cites some examples of this as accidents 
              that just happened to save the industry at various times. The reality 
              is that the opening of new markets is inherently part of the process.&#160; 
              There are many applications today that are waiting for the communication 
              speeds, memory, and computational capacities of future years (such 
              as ubiquitous full-immersion, visual-auditory <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> for 
              business and personal encounters, augmented reality and telepresence 
              applications, and many others). </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The essence of Moore's argument had been that it was 
              becoming possible to manufacture increasingly complex integrated 
              circuits and that the price per component was dropping radically. 
              The limiting factor would be efficient amortization of design investments. 
              This could be done in two <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> ways: either by making high volumes 
              of single function or by making designs that could be used for many 
              different chips. The first path led to Intel's focus on memory chips 
              and the latter, a couple of years later, to microprocessors.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Also by increases in chip volume created through new 
              applications that result from the greater capabilities of each new 
              generation of chip technology.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: In his presentation, Moore analyzed the different causes 
              of the exponential development. First, the physical size of the 
              chips had been growing approximately exponentially. In 1975, chip 
              sizes of the most complex chips were about 20 times larger than 
              in 1959. Second, the <a class="thought" href="entries/miniaturization_entry.html">miniaturization</a> of component dimensions had 
              also evolved at roughly exponential pace. This miniaturization had 
              led to about 32-fold increase in component density in 15 years. 
              The combination of increased chip size and component miniaturization 
              therefore seemed to explain about 640-fold increase in the number 
              of components. According to Moore's prediction, however, in 1975 
              chips were supposed to contain more than 640 components. The remaining 
              100-fold increase Moore associated with "circuit and device 
              cleverness". New technology, such as better isolation of components 
              and innovations in circuit layouts had made it possible to pack 
              more components closer to each other (Moore, 1975).</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Miniaturization of component dimensions results not only 
              in more components per unit size, but also in faster circuits, since 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s have less distance to travel.&#160; In addition, there 
              is innovation on every level in both hardware and software.&#160; Beyond 
              just packing more and faster circuitry onto each square millimeter, 
              there have been many innovations in processor design, such as pipelining, 
              register caches, <a class="thought" href="entries/parallel_processing_entry.html">parallel processing</a>, more powerful instruction 
              sets, etc. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Moore revised his original growth rate estimate and proposed 
              that by the end of the decade, the number of components on the most 
              complex chips would double about every two years. Soon after, this 
              prediction became known as "Moore's Law." According to 
              Moore, the name was coined by Carver Mead (Yang, 2000).</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This was a revision, not an observation of the data changing.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: In 1975, Moore implicitly changed the meaning of Moore's 
              Law. As he had done ten years before, he was still counting the 
              number of components on semiconductor chips. Instead of focusing 
              on optimal cost circuits, however, he now mapped the evolution of 
              maximum complexity of existing chips. Indeed, in an article written 
              a few years later, the famous growth curve is explicitly called 
              "Moore's Law limit" (Moore, 1979). At that point the growth 
              estimate is presented as the maximum complexity achievable by technology. 
              In Moore's 1979 paper, which shows a picture with component counts 
              of Intel chips manufactured in 1977 and 1978, most chips fall one, 
              two, or even three orders of magnitude below this limit.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Although Moore showed a chart like this, plotting the 
              maximum complexity of chip technology at different points in time 
              is not an appropriate way to measure performance.&#160; One has to measure 
              performance on the most cost- effective <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ation of computing 
              technology at each point in time.&#160; So, for example, one would not 
              just measure mainframe performance, because after minicomputers 
              became established, mainframes were not the most cost-effective 
              implementation.&#160; The same thing happened to minicomputers when personal 
              computers became established.&#160; These older markets only persisted 
              because customers were locked into legacy applications, but these 
              were not the most cost-effective <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">platform</a>s.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: . . . .in 1975.. . . Intel introduced the 16-kilobit 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ccd_entry.html">CCD</a>, the Intel 2416. In the same year Intel also introduced its 
              2116-chip, a 16-kilobit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip. 
              Such a chip would have contained somewhat over 16,384 transistors, 
              including some control circuitry, and about 16,384 capacitors. Since 
              the mid-1970s, complexity has been counted based on the number of 
              transistors. Moore's earlier calculations, however, were based on 
              the total number of components. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is typical of Tuomi nit-picking.&#160; The reality is 
              that regardless of whether one looks at number of components or 
              number of transistors, there has been clear exponential growth.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Moore presented a new exponential growth curve in his 
              1979 paper. According to it, the man-hours per month required for 
              integrated circuit production was also growing exponentially. Moore 
              went on to note:</i></p>
<p><i>"If we assume that the cost in man-hours per month is inflating 
              at 10 per cent per year (a conservative figure considering the need 
              for increased computer support, software, etc.), then the costs 
              double every two years ... This cost can be contrasted with manufacturing 
              costs, which are largely independent of device complexity. Whereas 
              manufacturing costs were once dominant and exceeded those of design, 
              the situation is now reversing, with design costs becoming dominant".</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: One has to take into consideration the exponential growth 
              in volumes that were also taking place. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Moore also noted that the problems that slowed down the 
              growth of semiconductor complexity in the 1965-1968 period had not 
              been solved. Engineers were still unable to design and define products 
              that would have used silicon efficiently. Instead, the industry 
              was saved by the invention of two product categories where these 
              problems could be avoided. . . .The calculator was an important 
              product because it was a relatively simple system. Merely connecting 
              four integrated circuits (that had about 40 pins) created a calculator. 
              The interconnection problem, therefore, was tractable. As calculators 
              were produced in high volumes, the design costs could be justified. 
              Memory chips, in turn, were easy to design and universal in their 
              functionality, and therefore also high volume products with low 
              design costs. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi assumes that the industry just happened to be "saved" 
              by the lucky invention of these two product categories.&#160; But the 
              introduction of new product categories made feasible by the greater 
              price-performance of each new generation of semiconductor technology 
              is inherently part of the process.&#160; More powerful chips, which have 
              been occurring on a regular basis, lead to new product categories, 
              which in turn lead to greater volumes.&#160; The pace of this type of 
              innovation has increased in recent years with the rapid introduction 
              of new types of digital products.&#160; In addition, another inherent 
              aspect of progress in information-based technologies is new paradigms 
              on every level.&#160; Old problems are often not directly solved &#150; they 
              are circumvented by introducing new paradigms, new applications, 
              and new markets. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Moore himself has noted:</i></p>
<p><i>"I never said 18 months. I said one year, and then two 
              years ... Moore's Law has been the name given to everything that 
              changes exponentially. I saw, if Gore invented the Internet, I invented 
              the exponential" (Yang, 2000). The historically inaccurate 
              18 months doubling time has been extremely widely used. It is possible 
              even to find fictive quotes of Moore's 1975 presentation saying: 
              "The number of transistors per chip will double every 18 months." 
              </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi is correct that the 18 month figure is incorrect 
              (for most measures).&#160; Moore never said it, and it does not match 
              the data.&#160; Tuomi continues to beat this dead horse repeatedly in 
              the rest of this paper.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: As noted above, Moore never claimed that the number of 
              components would double every 18 months. The first version, the 
              doubling of components on a chip every year, would mean that the 
              number of components would increase 1024-fold per decade. The second 
              version, doubling every two years, would translate into a much more 
              modest increase of 32 per decade. In fact, the International Technology 
              Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS, 2001) uses as the basis of its 
              near-term microprocessor forecasts three-year doubling time. A three-year 
              doubling time means that the number of transistors on a chip increases 
              about nine-fold in a decade.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: The ITRS roadmap shows doubling of the number of bits 
              per DRAM memory chip every two years: 1 Gb in 2003, 2Gb in 2005, 
              and so on up to 64Gb chips in 2015-2016.&#160; That represents a 24-month 
              doubling time.&#160; If we factor in additional improvements, including 
              faster <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing time and anticipated lower chip costs, the doubling 
              time in price-performance will be less than 24 months.&#160; </p>
<p>If one looks only at the <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in feature size in the ITRS 
              roadmap for microprocessors, one gets a doubling of capacity per 
              mm<sup>2</sup> in 36 months, but this is consistent with the rate 
              of reduction of feature size going back to 1965.&#160; Despite this, 
              the doubling time for the number of transistors per microprocessor 
              has been 24 months, as I cited earlier.&#160; The cost per transistor 
              has been coming down by half every 19 months.&#160; And when we factor 
              in the increases in speed, the cost per transistor cycle has been 
              coming down by half every 13 months.&#160; </p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that whereas increasing the 
              number of bits in a memory chip increases its utility without limit, 
              there is a limit to the number of transistors that are desirable 
              in a microprocessor. At a certain level of complexity, we would 
              rather concentrate on reducing the cost per microprocessor and using 
              multiple processors than to continue adding complexity to a single 
              processor.&#160; The same consideration does not apply to DRAM.&#160; When 
              all of these factors are considered, the doubling time for price-performance 
              for microprocessors in the ITRS roadmap is less than 24 months. 
              Intel's own roadmap is somewhat more aggressive than ITRS.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Over several decades the differences obviously increase 
              dramatically. During the four decades of validity often claimed 
              for Moore's Law the difference between one-year and three-year doubling 
              time means about eight orders of magnitude. In other words, to get 
              the same number of transistors, the slower growth path would require 
              us to buy 100 million chips, instead of one. So, although a few 
              months more or less in the doubling rate might not appear to be 
              a big deal, actually it is.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: As I pointed at the beginning of my response, there is 
              no confusion between one-year and three-year doubling times.&#160; The 
              trends have been very consistent and both the ITRS and Intel road 
              maps project the same rate of exponential growth out through 2016.&#160; 
              Whether one gets a 12 month doubling time or a 36 month doubling 
              time depends on what is being measured.&#160; If one looks at a single 
              issue such as line width, one gets longer doubling times.&#160; If, however, 
              one considers the multiple levels in which innovation takes place, 
              the doubling times are closer to 12 months.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: As specific chip types usually have a long lifetime during 
              which the costs and other parameters of the chip change, the ITRS 
              roadmap differentiates four main life-cycle phases. The first is 
              the year of demonstration. This is the year when the feasibility 
              of a specific characteristic, for example the number of transistors 
              on a single chip, is first demonstrated. The second phase, market 
              introduction, usually two or three years later, is defined to occur 
              when the leading manufacturer ships small quantities of engineering 
              samples. The third phase, production, is defined to occur when the 
              leading manufacturer starts shipping the chip in volume quantities 
              and a second manufacturer follows within three months. The lowest 
              cost phase emerges when the production processes have been optimized 
              and competition does its work. For example, the 1-gigabit DRAM was 
              demonstrated in 1997, introduced in 1999, and is expected to be 
              in volume production in 2003. Similarly, the Intel Itanium processor 
              was announced in 1994, was originally planned to be on market in 
              late 1997, but was delayed and became <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly available in 
              2001. Market researchers currently project that Itanium will garner 
              less than 10 per cent of the market for <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> computing in 2007 
              (Markoff and Lohr, 2002).</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Valid methodologies consider the most cost-effective 
              form of memory or processor at each point in time.&#160; Obviously one 
              can obtain invalid results by failing to do this.&#160; Tuomi makes this 
              mistake later in this essay by concentrating on mainframe trends 
              way past the point that mainframes represented the most cost-effective 
              method of computing.&#160; In addition, graphs of processor speeds and 
              density use the date of production so we can compare consistent 
              points in development of each device. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Using this data we can fit an exponential growth curve 
              and see how good the fit is. . . . . According to this simple fit, 
              there were some five million transistors missing from Pentium II 
              in 1997, representing about 70 per cent, and some 7.5 million, or 
              some 18 per cent, too many in the Pentium 4 in 2000. The estimate 
              for Pentium 4 comes relatively close to its actual value as the 
              data, indeed, has been used to fit the exponential, and the final 
              point is heavily weighted. The error would be greater if we were 
              to use previous points to fit the curve and then predict the number 
              of transistors of Pentium 4.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi concentrates here on variances of the actual curve 
              (which is clearly exponential and has about a 24 month doubling 
              time) to a "predicted value."&#160; This is irrelevant.&#160; It is true that 
              many observers quote an 18 month doubling time for price-performance.&#160; 
              18 months happens to be approximately correct for the price per 
              transistor (we get 19 months), but not accurate for the number of 
              transistors per microprocessor.&#160; There seems to be little point 
              in repeatedly making this point.&#160; Tuomi is clearly not demonstrating 
              a lack of exponential growth.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: One problem . . . . is that the clock speed is not directly 
              related to the amount of information processed. For example, the 
              original Intel 8088 PC microprocessor took on average 12 clock cycles 
              to execute a single instruction. Modern microprocessors can execute 
              three or more instructions per clock cycle.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: The improvements that Tuomi cites only serve to accelerate 
              improvement further.&#160; One could also add increases in word and instruction 
              sizes (from 4 bit to 8 to 16 to 32 to 64 to 128) and other improvements.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: With the understanding that the clock frequency does 
              not really measure processor performance, one may, however, check 
              how clock frequency has evolved during the lifetime of microprocessors. 
              Information on average processor clock speeds has been collected 
              by Berndt et al. (2000). This is shown in Figure 4 (see above) on 
              processor speed. The data covers distinctly identified personal 
              computers that have been marketed and sold in the U.S. Processor 
              speeds for mobile computers are excluded from Figure 4.</i></p>
<p><i>&#160;Figure 4 has several interesting characteristics. First, 
              it should be noted that the data do not directly represent advances 
              in microprocessor technology. It is based on computers that have 
              been marketed to end customers. In that sense it does reflect changes 
              in the actually available processing power. As can be seen from 
              the Figure, until the end of 1980s the increase in the reported 
              processor speed was quite modest. During the first decade, processor 
              speed grew about four-fold and between 1986-1995 somewhat less than 
              10-fold. In about 1994, the clock speed started to grow much more 
              rapidly.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi's chart 4 (see page 4 above) on processor speed 
              is an exponential (and represents only one factor contributing to 
              processor price-performance). </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: By 1985, then, demand had started to be less than infinite 
              and the semiconductor industry was not endogenously driven by technology. 
              In 1982, the increase in MIPS ratings stopped for about three and 
              half years instead of following an exponential trend. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is not true if one looks at Tuomi's own chart (see 
              Tuomi's figure 5 earlier in this essay).&#160; Although he does not place 
              any points on the chart during 1982-1985, the points starting in 
              1985 are at an even higher level than would be expected by extrapolating 
              the 1970-1982 trend line to 1985. </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: During the last decades, computer clock frequency and 
              the number of instructions per second have become very inaccurate 
              indicators of processor power. Since the Intel 80286 processors 
              shipped in 1982, microprocessors have utilized parallel processing 
              in many alternative forms. By parallelism, more <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s can be 
              accomplished within a time unit. For example, the processor can 
              be loaded with instructions that contain several operations, it 
              can have several execution units that process multiple instructions 
              within one cycle, or the processing of operations can be started 
              before the previous operations have finished. All these forms of 
              parallelism have commonly been used since the mid-1980s. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is one of many innovations.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Moreover, since the 1990s, processor <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>s have 
              increasingly relied on program <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">compiler</a>s that detect and optimize 
              parallelism in the <a class="thought" href="entries/source_code_entry.html">source code</a> programs. Indeed, the innovations 
              in compiler technology have been a main driver in processing power 
              improvements. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is an unjustified oversimplification. It is only 
              one of many factors.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Computing power is rarely determined by the capabilities 
              of microprocessors. Usually, the microprocessor is connected to 
              external memory and input and output devices with links that are 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> of magnitude slower than connections within the chip. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: The capabilities of microprocessors are certainly important 
              as one driving force.&#160; Communication busses have always been about 
              an order of magnitude slower than communication within a chip.&#160; 
              However, all of the various systems in a computer, such as the hard 
              disk, the communication busses, and other devices, have benefited 
              from exponential improvements in capability.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The attempt to develop measurement systems for computer 
              processing power have made it clear that the definition of computing 
              power depends on the tasks for which the computer is used. Therefore 
              there is no well-defined criterion or data for arguing that computer 
              power would have increased exponentially. On the contrary, it has 
              frequently been argued that most of the increase in computer capabilities 
              has been consumed by software. This is often formulated as Wirths 
              law: "Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster".</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Try going back and using old software to do common contemporary 
              tasks.&#160; We quickly get used to, and rely on, new features and capabilities.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Clearly, there have been huge qualitative changes in 
              desktop computers during this time. The problem, then, is how to 
              take them into account.</i></p>
<p><i>One approach is to create so-called matched-model price indexes. 
              It is possible to measure price changes of a given computer type 
              across several years and deduce from this the actual price change. 
              So, instead of looking yearly changes in the list price of desktop 
              computers, .. . we can look how the price for a given PC <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> 
              has changed. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is not appropriate because a given model of computer 
              does not necessarily remain the best value model.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: A complete personal computer contains several different 
              types of chips and other components, such as <a class="thought" href="entries/hard_disk_entry.html">hard disk</a> drives, CR-<a class="thought" href="entries/rom_entry.html">ROM</a> 
              drives, a keyboard, and a displays. Price changes in PC, therefore, 
              reflect quality changes in several different types of technologies. 
              The hedonic estimation models, however, tend to break down when 
              new components and functionality are added to computers. When notebook 
              computers started to become important towards the end of the 1980s, 
              the different existing technical characteristics became revalued. 
              For example, more memory perhaps meant progress for desktop users 
              but for notebook users it implied shorter battery lifetime or the 
              need to stay close to the power plug when using the computer. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Battery life for a notebook computer has not decreased.&#160; 
              Fuel cells are on the way, with dramatically improved battery (fuel 
              cell) life.&#160; NEC is introducing fuel-cell-powered notebooks in 2004. 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: . . . .recent growth may reflect increase in cost-adjusted 
              performance. For example, architectural changes in microprocessors 
              during the second half of the 1990s moved much of the external and 
              expensive cache memory onto the processor chip. On the other hand, 
              the rapid improvements in average PCs sold might also reflect, for 
              example, availability of consumer credit and funding for information 
              technology intensive firms.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This reflects the increase in the number of chips that 
              have been produced, which represents another exponential trend.&#160; 
            </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Price changes, of course, reflect market competition, 
              imbalances in supply and demand, technical change, and new markets 
              that open as new uses are found for technology. These have very 
              little to do with the original formulations of Moore's Law. Yet, 
              one may ask whether the current economic evidence supports the claim 
              the cost of computing halves every 18 months. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi is really stuck on beating this dead horse.&#160; The 
              doubling time (of price-performance or other measurement) depends 
              entirely on what is being measured.&#160; Some in fact are 18 months, 
              others range from under 12 months to 36 months.&#160; The 36 month categories, 
              however, do not reflect price-performance.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The change in the average values as well as the yearly 
              fluctuations show that the price decreases have not followed an 
              exponential trend. The great differences between the results of 
              the different modeling exercises show that we do not know how quality-adjusted 
              computer prices should be measured or how they have changed during 
              the last decades.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi's statement, "the price decreases have not followed 
              an exponential trend," is a remarkable conclusion.&#160; His own paper 
              provides myriads of exponential trends.&#160; This conclusion defies 
              common sense and ignores reams of data that can be looked at in 
              many different ways, all of which show exponential trends in price-performance, 
              and other measures of capability.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: In the previous sections we have reviewed the original 
              formulations of Moore's Law and its revisions. We found that Moore 
              changed his interpretations of Moore's Law during the 1960s and 
              1970s, and that its subsequent extensions have added qualitatively 
              new and important aspects to it. Whereas the original formulations 
              of Moore's Law focused on counting components on integrated circuits, 
              its extensions made claims of exponential increase in processing 
              power and exponentially dropping quality-adjusted prices of computing. 
              We reviewed the available empirical evidence for these different 
              versions of Moore's Law and found that they have little empirical 
              support. Semiconductor technology has not developed according to 
              Moore's Law. The claims that future developments in semiconductors, 
              computer technology, or information processing would be determined 
              by the continuation of Moore's Law are, therefore, obviously invalid.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: The above statements only make sense if one interprets 
              Moore's Law as strictly being the 18 month statement.&#160; Tuomi is 
              correct that the 18 month version that is often quoted is not correct 
              &#150; but to imply that there is no exponential trend in computing and 
              semiconductors has no validity.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Here, of course, the industry <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> play an important 
              role. For example, computers require software. One of the important 
              drivers for buying increasingly powerful computing equipment has 
              been that new versions of <a class="thought" href="entries/operating_system_entry.html">operating system</a> and application software 
              have typically demanded more processing power. Although it seems 
              clear that today personal computers are much more functional than 
              twenty years ago, it is not clear how much more functional they 
              are.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil:&#160; For many applications, linear improvement requires exponential 
              gains.&#160; For example, we need exponential gains in computing power 
              to get linear gains in chess scores.&#160; This assumes we hold the software 
              constant.&#160; Recent progress in the software of terminal-leaf evaluation 
              in the minimax algorithm shows that improvements can be gained from 
              software alone.&#160; However, linear progress in what are inherently 
              exponential problems is very powerful.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The regular doubling and exponential growth that underlies 
              the different versions of Moore's Law implies a very unique claim. 
              It fundamentally says that the described phenomenon grows purely 
              based on its internal characteristics. Exponential growth means 
              that after the growth speed is set, the future unfolds based on 
              nothing but the current state of the system. Contrary to what some 
              commentators of Moore's Law have claimed, exponential growth is 
              not uncommon. When we put money on a fixed interest rate account, 
              and reinvest the returns, it will grow exponentially. In this sense, 
              a bank account is a prototype of self-determined endogenous growth. 
              Exponential growth, however, is very uncommon in real world. It 
              usually ends when it starts to matter.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi provides no basis to conclude that exponential 
              growth in computing has ended or is about to end.&#160; As mentioned 
              earlier, the inherent limits to exponential growth of computation 
              and communication are extremely high (that is, the minimum matter 
              and energy required to compute a bit or transmit a bit is extremely 
              low). </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: During its history, the semiconductor industry has several 
              times hit the speed limit. First it was bailed out by the digital 
              clock and calculator industry, then by mini and mainframe computer 
              industry. In the mid-1980s, just when no one seemed to be able to 
              make a profit, the IBM PC and <a class="thought" href="entries/microsoft_entry.html">Microsoft</a> saved the day. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Bailed out?&#160; This is the inherent process of innovation 
              powering these exponential trends.&#160; The number of such "saves" (in 
              Tuomi's terminology) is increasing.&#160; We recently have cell phones, 
              digital cameras, PDAs, portable game machines, MP3 players, pocket 
              computers, and many other new categories.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: It is . . . . no surprise that semiconductor industry 
              has not actually followed an exponential growth trend. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is a remarkable conclusion that does not follow 
              even from his own reasoning.&#160; His own paper is filled with exponential 
              trends, even if most are not 18 month doubling times.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: As the size and importance of computer and information 
              processing technologies now is becoming more than a couple of percents 
              of national economies, it can be predicted that the endogenous growth 
              in this industry cluster is about to end. The imbalance between 
              supply and demand shifts and the social basis of demand makes itself 
              increasingly visible. The <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">open source</a> movement, for example, effectively 
              disconnects the economics of operating systems from the economics 
              of semiconductor manufacturing, thus splitting the industry cluster 
              in half.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is a big leap, with no support to land on.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: In reality, the belief in rapid development has often 
              paid off. Discontinuous innovations have created new uses and markets 
              for semiconductors and have produced an expanding market. Instead 
              of filling a market need, the semiconductor industry has actively 
              and aggressively created markets. At times the aggregate market 
              has grown at a speed that has appeared to be almost infinite in 
              relation to existing manufacturing capability.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: These references to "infinite" demand make no sense.&#160; 
              Nothing is infinite in today's world of technology.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: The rapid growth of semiconductor industry, therefore, 
              has not been driven simply by technical advance in semiconductor 
              industry. Although the aggressive pricing policy has facilitated 
              the wide use of semiconductors, the high demand for semiconductor 
              technology has fundamentally reflected a continuous stream of innovations 
              that have occurred outside the semiconductor industry. In other 
              words, the apparent explosive big bang in semiconductor technology 
              is also an illusion. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi's statement that "the apparent explosive big bang 
              in semiconductor technology is . . . an illusion" is another remarkable 
              conclusion.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: . . . .many discussions on the future of Moore's Law 
              have focused on physical limits. In recent years economic considerations 
              have gained legitimacy also in this context, partly because Moore 
              himself has frequently predicted that the increases in chip complexity 
              will not be limited by physics but by the exponentially increasing 
              costs of manufacturing plants.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Three-dimensional methodologies promise to reverse this 
              &#150; new approaches use self-organizing methods to allow many faulty 
              components in a system.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: As computing technology becomes increasingly pervasive, 
              we eventually have to ask what benefits it actually brings. Fundamentally, 
              this question can only be answered in a theoretical framework that 
              is able to define development. In theory, there are many different 
              ways to approach this question, both old and new. It should, however, 
              be clear that development cannot be reduced to shrinking line-widths, 
              maximum number of components on a chip, or minimal manufacturing 
              costs. </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: These remain, nonetheless, powerful driving factors, 
              although it is correct to say that there are other factors of innovation.&#160; 
              Moreover, exponential growth is not limited to memory or MIPS, but 
              includes essentially all information-based technologies.&#160; Other 
              examples include magnetic disk density (a completely independent 
              phenomenon), telecommunication speeds and price-performance, DNA 
              sequencing, <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a>, human knowledge, and many 
              others. </p>
<p><b>Responses to Ilkka Tuomi's "Kurzweil, Moore, and Accelerating 
              Change" </b><a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p><i>Tuomi: As Moore noted, on average integrated circuit component 
              counts grew rapidly during the 1960s, almost with a one-year doubling 
              time. During the first decade of microprocessors, the transistor 
              counts grew at about 22 months doubling time, when measured using 
              a least squares trend, which slowed to about 33 months during the 
              following decade. During the 1990s, transistor counts grew at varying 
              speeds. In the Intel's Pentium chips, the transistor counts grew 
              with around 54 month doubling time. After that the transistor counts 
              grew very rapidly, partly because large amounts of memory were added 
              onto microprocessor chips (Tuomi, 2002b).</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil:&#160; As noted earlier, Tuomi's 54 month doubling time is 
              not consistent with the historical data, as indicated in the graph 
              on transistors in Intel microprocessors provided earlier.&#160; There 
              are always less capable processors offered than the current standard, 
              so including these on the chart only serves to skew the results.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>More importantly, measurements related to processors, whether transistor 
              counts, or MIPS ratings, are not the most meaningful items to measure.&#160; 
              We are more concerned with performance per unit cost.&#160; Also note 
              that MIPS measure does not take into consideration word size.&#160; Since 
              word sizes have increased over time, there has been even greater 
              progress than the MIPS ratings alone would suggest.&#160; See my graph 
              above on processor performance (MIPS).&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Alternative growth rate estimates can be based simply 
              on transistor counts on representative microprocessors introduced 
              at two points of time. If we use the first microprocessor, Intel 
              4004, as a starting point, the exponential growth time for the 1971-82 
              period is 21 months, for the 1971-91 period 26 months, and for the 
              1971-98 period 27 months.</i><i>This calculation indicates a slowing 
              down in the component growth rate. If we separately calculate the 
              growth rate for the 1982-91 period, it is about 35 months, and for 
              the 1991-98 period somewhat over 30 months. It therefore appears 
              that during the first decade of microprocessors component counts 
              increased much more rapidly than during the 80s. In the 1990s the 
              growth rate was faster, 30 months for both the first half and the 
              whole 1990-1998 period, but considerably slower than during the 
              first decade of the microprocessor history.</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: These numbers are also dubious, but even less relevant 
              than MIPS ratings.&#160; There is an optimal number of transistors for 
              the functionality of a processor for a given word length and instruction 
              set, so measuring the number of transistors is not the most appropriate 
              measure of the exponential growth of price-performance.&#160; Nonetheless, 
              there has been exponential progress on this measure.&#160; See my graph 
              above on transistors in Intel processors.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: If one studies the share of inputs that are used computer 
              manufacturing in the US, one can see that the biggest input cost 
              is associated with wholesale trade (about 14 percent of total output) 
              and semiconductor devices (also about 14 percent). This is followed 
              by payments for other electronic component manufacturing, software 
              publishers (about 9.5 percent), computer storage device</i></p>
<p><i>manufacturing, computer peripheral manufacturing, internal sales 
              in the computer industry, and management consulting services. A 
              more detailed study reveals that computer manufacturing requires 
              such inputs as air <a class="thought" href="entries/transportation_entry.html">transportation</a>, computer terminals, sheet metal 
              work, and food services and drinking places.&#160;&#160; The average price 
              changes in the 1990s are greatly influenced by the extremely rapid 
              drop of prices in the second half of the decade. For example, the 
              semiconductor input prices in the computer industry dropped over 
              40 percent annually during 1995-99. In the first half of the decade, 
              however, they declined only 11 percent annually.&#160; </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: This is all irrelevant.&#160; We are concerned with what the 
              computer industry has been able to accomplish in terms of price-performance, 
              not in measuring what they pay for their "inputs," such as "food 
              services and drinking places."&#160; We see exponential improvement in 
              all facets of computer price-performance: MIPS per dollar, RAM capacity, 
              hard disk capacity, and other features.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: A reasonable estimate for the average annual decline 
              in quality-adjusted computer prices is probably about 18-30 percent 
              during the last couple of decades, which corresponds to 2.6 to 4.2 
              year "doubling times."</i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: As I cited above, Tuomi makes this mistake repeatedly.&#160; 
              A 30 percent decline in price means a price of 70% (of the original 
              price) after one year, 49% after two years.&#160; Thus the price has 
              fallen to less than half in 2 years, so the doubling time is less 
              than 2 years, not 2.6 years.&#160; This consistent error is significant 
              since Tuomi is citing "high" doubling times as evidence that estimates 
              of 2 year doubling times are not accurate.&#160; Of course, the doubling 
              time depends entirely on what one is measuring.&#160; </p>
<p><i>Tuomi: Clouds are continuously changing their form. The ripples 
              on a stormy sea encode huge amounts of information. Any argument 
              about speed of change therefore has to neglect most sources of change. 
              The selection is obviously made by relevance. When we say that the 
              evolution is progressing at an accelerating pace, we have to abstract 
              away all change that doesn't matter. 20 Which sources of change 
              are left out of the equation depends on our present interests.&#160; 
              </i></p>
<p>Kurzweil: Tuomi is missing the entire point of the law of accelerating 
              returns, which pertains to exponential growth of the capacity and 
              price-performance of information-based technologies.&#160; It is not 
              my position that all exponential trends go on indefinitely.&#160; </p>
<p>Indeed, exponential trends do hit a natural limit, but the key 
              point is that the known limits for computation and communication 
              are extremely high, vastly exceeding current technology.&#160; When I 
              refer to a paradigm shift (such as integrated circuits, or the Internet), 
              I am not referring to any type of change, such as "clouds . . . 
              . changing their form," but rather technological methods that provide 
              for the continuation of the exponential growth of the capacity and 
              price-performance of an information related technology.&#160; </p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> <center><p class="mindxquote"> Ignoring these other significant factors of improvement, the contemporary computer provides MIPS of processing at a cost that is 2^22 lower than the computer I used in 1967.  That's 22 doublings in 36 years, or about 19 months per doubling. </p></center>
<br>
<center><p class="mindxquote"> With a speed improvement of approximately 10^3 in 34 years (1968 to 2002), the cost per transistor cycle decreased by a factor of 5 x 10^9 (= 2^32), resulting in a doubling time of just over 12 months.11  Even this analysis takes into consideration only semiconductor density and process improvements, and does not take into consideration improvements at higher levels such as processor design (for example, pipelining, parallel instruction execution, and other innovations). </p></center>
<br>
In my opinion the cost per transistor cycle is quite similar the growth in computing power per cost unit, but the improvements at higher levels such as processor design WERE NECESSARY to efficently use many transistors. Using the old architecture we could not use all the transistors in efficient way. Comparing cost per transistor cycle growth with cost per computing power we see that the transistors are utilized less efficiently and the changes in the archtecture of processors are made to make the best use of transistor cycles. The recent Intel procesors with two procesor cores inside a single chip is a good example in the recent architecture change direction.

Subject: Re: Prep for Debate
<br>
<br>
Ray,
<br>
<br>
I thought you might be interested in my criticism of Ilkka's reply to your response to his critique of your analysis.
<br>
<br>
Ilkka, 
<br>
<br>
As to the analysis of Kurzweil and his claim, unfortunately, my reaction to your paper is the same as my reaction to your prior ones: strong on rhetoric, lacking in data, and rife with analytical errors (statistical sub-sampling, interpretive error, data selection and omission biases, etc).  
<br>
<br>
The one place where your analysis seems to squarely overlap with Kurzweil's is in the area of Intel processor transistor count (I will use "Moore's law" in quote marks for reference to this graph you showed with three segments). Your rhetoric is strong, but please, apply the same rigor you ask of Kurzweil to yourself:
<br>
<br>
1) Use your full set of data if you want, but run the least-squares line through ALL the points. How does it turn out?
<br>
<br>
2) You do not refute Kurzweil's most withering attack: that the vertical step jumps between your three segments have been conveniently left out. By lumping processor families, you have effectively removed the architectural improvements between families and reduced the effect that you are measuring to process geometry shrinks over short periods of times -- with the same transistor counts per family. For an example of how absurd your clustering is, imagine you took it one step further -- rather than lumping the 386 and 486 (which are very different), if you split them into two curves, they would be flat! The transistor count would be static over time. By clumping the data, you have conveniently created a very misleading curve -- one that may have misled you.
<br>
<br>
3) Regarding your quote: "We do bad science if we drop data points simply because they do not fit our theory." Excluding the Pentium III, IV and other recent transistor counts is fairly inexcusable. The data is readily available from the very sources you footnote in your paper. Excluding the most recent and easily obtained data can only lead your readers to assume that they don't support your conclusions (true) and wonder why they have been omitted. 
<br>
<br>
4) Regarding your bad science quote as applied to Kurzweil and your "Moore's Law" graph, you are totally missing the point. You need to look at the envelope of new product releases. It is these cutting edge tools that are used to design the next generation, and so on. Old processors go to industrial control applications, like the 386 architecture today. They get released after process shrinks and cheaper packages become available. They still get sold, years after they are introduced, but it is not relevant (and, as an aside, their cost-performance becomes dominated by packaging costs). Who cares if 4 bit microcontrollers are still being sold today? They are not driving the future of "Moore's Law." It is as if you want to reinterpret the phenomenon of accelerating change as a market weighted average of "transistors per processor sold that year" -- but you take a tiny step in that direction. You could go all the way, in either direction, and have different phenomena to analyze, but instead you chose a data set that has no meaning.
<br>
<br>
If you can see the absurdity of leaving multiple 386 and 486 points on the page, what happens when you remove them leaving the "capability frontier" and run the line through all Intel processor points? 
<br>
<br>
I do remain very curious about these topics and would very much like to see any further graphs that you generate.... as I can strip the rhetoric from the data. =) 
<br>
<br>
Best of all would be a graph from you with predictive power. Ultimately, this will be of keen interest to your readers. What might we expect of the near future from understanding the past?
<br>
<br>
Thanks,
<br>
Steve

You need a better program, which may take longer to come up with an answer than it would if it were running on a faster computer in the future.

I believe Ray's methodology consists of scanning an existing human brain/body and creating a simulation based on the scan results.  There would be no need to understand how the scanned model produced intelligence.  Current neuroscience would expect a functionally equivalent software model to return the same outputs, given the same inputs.  That is, ask the model about Tuesday and it will reply: "don't remind me!"
<br>
<br>
Scanning and modelling is a methodology currently used, say, in weather simulation and is quite "do-able".  The computer doing it can be running Windows 2000 (I hesitate to say '98).
<br>
<br>
The problem is hardware.  Even highly optimised code requires, by Ray's estimate, a 20 petaflop computer to simulate a brain in real time.  The second hardware problem is brain scanning which will require a similar degree of advancement.
<br>
<br>
Both items of hardware are improving by Moore's law, and early attempts at brain simulation might occur by 2009/10.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Scanning and modelling is not a new concept. It works in say predicting weather exactly because we have relatively simple set of partial differential equations that model weather phenomena well. We only work with a few simple inputs (measurements like pressure, humidity, air mass velocity, etc) and it all gives reasonably well predictions. It does require lots of computational power, but the model is shall I say simple from mathematical point of view. 
<br>
<br>
Having a detailed brain scan, is just a bunch of raw data, that needs to be input to a model of a brain, that knows how to take that data and evolve it with various degrees of precision. 
<br>
Coming up with a working model, is again not a hardware problem. Modelling is mathematics and having a computer calculate the model is software engineering. 
<br>
<br>
You are making a mistake that capturing a state of the brain at a moment in time, somehow also captures how it will evolve from there on, how each neuron will fire and the mind that would be a product of those simulated chemical reactions would be determined. But that is no more true, than saying that because you measured temerature, pressure, humidity and velocity of air, you know how the weather will evolve without having a mathematical formula that connects all those parameters somehow and evolves them.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I agree that it's a massive, complicated problem.  But understanding, then emulating the behaviour and interactions of an existing complex physical structure is not in the same league of difficulty as creating artificial intelligence from software ab initio.
<br>
<br>
I'm not an expert, so I'll stop posting after this, but I think that some first steps have been taken.  I've read (sorry no sources, just Slashdot/KurzweilAI fuzzy memories) about modelling lobster neurons from MRI scans, and again vaguely something about a university setting up a software project to create a software model of part of a rat's brain at a neuronal level from scans.  I do not deny that it will be a massive, unguided, world-wide, interdisciplinary scientific effort of unfolding deeper understanding.  That's what the academic/capitalist world is good at.
<br>
<br>
But even supposing that we cannot understand how brain structures operate, the scanning and modelling will eventually get to the atomic level, and simple physics will work.  Again, no source but I remember an estimate that this would take another decade of Moore's law.  If modelled quantum interaction is necessary, another decade.
<br>
<br>
The point is that we have in our hands (OK, in our heads!) a working mechanical model of a thinking machine, and the necessary tinkerer's interest in getting to the bottom of it.  We will.  And then, as is the way, we'll speed it up and "improve" it, and it will improve itself, and then you're sick of hearing the rest.
<br>
<br>
To say the singularity is never going to happen because it might take several more decades, is to ignore the multi-billion-year time-line to date.  Even several more centuries of methodical effort until superintelligence is still a phenomenal: "Wow!".
<br>
<br>
But personally, I'd bet on the graph trends of about 2030ish.
<br>
<br>
(Any experts/scientists who understand brain modelling better than me should feel free to post any insights.  (If any real scientists post here - I know what you mean about true believer techno-rapturists - I suppose I am one to a degree, so your basic scepticism is right.  :-D))

<br>
<br>
Are you saying brain scans didn&#146;t contribute to the development of recent AI programs?  Or that scanning hasn&#146;t helped us recreate the function of certain areas of the brain?
<br>
<br>
This statement (and the post) are misleading.  It sounds as if we only have still pictures.  I agree; stills are of less use than videos of development.  However, we have much more than still pictures.  We can now watch individual neurons grow over short lengths of time &#150; we&#146;re not working with a snapshot of one moment.  From our brain scans, we now have an understanding of the visual cortex and can see how visual input is delivered piecemeal (7 or 8 layers, etc.)  Following that, we can mimic it &#150; that is recreate it using a more stable substrate.  Yes, we can build a computer that looks at the environment, more or less, like we do.  (needs reference)  We haven&#146;t finished scanning the entire Human Brain or discovering how all of its components interact, but we&#146;re well on the way.  
<br>
<br>
In short, we&#146;re not guessing what&#146;s under the hood of the car anymore.  (We're not like the ignorant monkey's trying to build a rocket.)  Instead, we&#146;re getting a clear picture of what drives us.  This understanding will assist us in creating software language for the coming increases in hardware.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>The whole time I read "The Age of Intelligent Machines", I couldn't wait to see how Ray thought to realize strong AI. 
<br>
<br>
Then I saw his proposal (scanning the human brain), then Ray lost my interest. So I totally agree with you on the point of scanning the human brain. Even if this is possible, (which I have my doubts on )we will only be having the "object" code of the human brain, so software will still be the problem! 
<br>
<br>
What I don't keep understanding is this "scanning". Everybody is talking about scanning, what are we meaning with this. Making pictures? So what...? 
<br>
<br>
One solution to Strong AI may (in Kurzweil's view) be when nanotechnology is possible, by sending nanobots in our brains to copy every neuron configuration etc, and after this we would rebuild the brain, in its fleshy form, now the problem is to try to understand it again....
<br>
<br>
By the way I am not a sceptic for AI or so, I just can't see how ever faster and faster computers can result in strong AI, since the software principles are still the "same"; there is still no "full" neural network computer, which runs at least the same as a "vonn Neumann" computer. 
<br>
<br>
Neural networks are widly used for pattern recognition, so they are still just a pheripial (sorry for my spelling) device (a slave of a conventional p.c) just like a mouse of the p.c, and not the "real" processing element (which our brain is).
<br>
<br>
I have another proposial regarding the "tech-talk". Why can't we stop using the MIPS and the FLOPS and keep referring to the amount of calculation a processor can do etc....., I don't think this is healthy for the discussion regarding (strong) AI. My opinion is that with the right formulas (If we can get them!) we could make strong AI with the present home p.c's, so please stop concentrating on the numbers and focus on the real issue here!  
<br>
<br>
So the problem is still software....:-(

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I think we should stop trying to copy the brain altogether.  What does AI stand for?  The A is for ARTIFICIAL, which means something different from natural, and the I stands for INTELLIGENCE, which means the brain's ability to manipulate incoming as well as stored data in order to survive in an ever-changing world.  
<br>
<br>
I think there is a wide range of methods by which we can manipulate data for various purposes that do not duplicate what nature has already created.  Right now we want to copy nature because that is the only model we have on hand.  But the computer itself, which is merely a method of turning tiny switches on and off, has driven us to come up with a number of methods to perceive, store, retrieve and manipulate data.  
<br>
<br>
The average human can neither perceive nor understand what a robot on Mars perceives and sends back to Earth.  It takes machines with computers and software to do that.  Humans can only understand it after it has been decoded and simplified for them.  So where does the greater intelligence lie?  In the human or in the machine?  I'd say that depends on how you want to define intelligence.  
<br>
<br>
Right now, we can't do the kinds of things a system of machines and software can do and the machine/software system can't do what humans can.  But put them together and you achieve a level of intelligence beyond what either of them is capable of.  
<br>
<br>
We need both of these types of intelligence to survive in a wider universe than the human species was brought up in.  In fact, we need more kinds of intelligence than we can even imagine today.  When we get beyond the boundaries of our world and our solar system, we will need to understand things that defy our current mental abilities, much as quantum mechanics and relativity were greater than our brains were able to grasp a couple of hundred years ago.  It wasn't until we were able to invent machines that could measure light and calculate probabability to near infinity that we were able to grasp a mere fraction of the meaning of it all.  
<br>
<br>
New discoveries will no doubt require new methods of perception and comprehension in order to understand an ever-expanding universe of experience.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Schematics of an engine are useful in understanding how the engine works.  No, it&#146;s not the end all &#150; but useful.  A schematic of the brain, taken at sufficiently high resolution, will allow us to understand how certain areas operate.  (See, Brocca&#146;s area, visual cortex, etc.)  A study of how all these areas communicate and interact will allow us to understand how consciousness arises from our neurological machinery.  (We can better study such areas and their gestalt interactions with increases in brain scanning devices.)  Once we understand consciousness as an emergent property (rather than a magical/metaphysical property) we can replicate it in a more stable substrate.  
<br>
<br>
All Mr. Kurzweil is saying is that, since the Human Brain is an example of operational machinery, a functional equivalent built the same way would also be conscious.  (Functional Equivalent meaning: something that can perform the same number of calculations per second, and is constructed with similar architecture.)
<br>
<br>
Of what use are pictures?  Pictures in sequence can be of tremendous use.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>You say that we could hook 100000 computers up to achieve artificial intelligence.  We already have, its called the internet and it is already displaying signs of artificial intelligence.  Just look at google.  Ask google a question, any question.  In many cases google will give you a reasonable answer.  What would it take to make google into a fully fledged artifical intelligence?
<br>
<br>
1.  Natural language processing.  Google doesn't need to know the exact meaning of things but it should have some idea of sentence structures and grammars.  
<br>
<br>
2. Bayesian or other inferential reasoning.  Google should have some Bayesian algorithms that it can use in natural language processing, pattern recognition for videos and audio etc.  Bayesian algorithms might give it some ability to understand language.  When I say understand I mean that google will have some understanding of how terms in the english language relate to each other.  It will obtain this understanding by examining text on the internet.  Google might also benefit from neural networks for pattern recognition and all the latest AI technologies for coming up with meaning out of all its data.  I should really specify that when I say Bayesian I am talking about Bayesian Graphical Networks.
<br>
<br>
3. Google should have the ability to process audio, video, pictures, text, genetics, statistics and all other sources of info.  It should have some basic ideas of good ways of processing things like using computer vision techniques, image processing, fourier analysis etc.  It should be able to do this intelligently
<br>
<br>
4.  It should have a person-like interface that you can talk to.
<br>
<br>
5.  The highest level of google that you interact with might be some kind of production rule system.  You talk to it.  The grammer of your sentences is analyzed and made into a tree.  The tree is a message to a production rule system that has been trained with genetic algorithms or bayesian algorithms to recognize certain messeges and respond to them in specific ways.  The production rule system evolves as time goes on based on how successful it is at giving people what they want.  Each tree is recognized as some pattern by the production rule system, the recognition doesn't have to be exact it can be a fuzzy recognition.  Each production rule results in either one of two results 1) A further messege is fired which can then lead to other messeges being fired 2) the messege results in a terminal action.  
<br>
<br>
6.  It would probably help a great deal if the intelligence of google were in some sense distributed.  People in the future will probably have mobile agents that will be extremely primitive but will probably have some small abilities to understand xml and perform some deductive and interferential reasoning (e.g. a small shopping agent which you could ask to find the best deal on plasma television).  An information economy might develop over the internet whereby these mobile agents exchange useful tidbits of info.  A big information exchange for the mobile agents would be google which would have tonnes of info.  Thus google could query mobile agents for information in exchange for some other information
<br>
<br>
Anyways I don't really know what I am talking about but I feel sure that out of the internet the first AI will be born.  All this information is also in a Wired article.</p></td>

Godel has shown us we could never plot all our own actions, because of incompleteness of set theory...a sub set couldn't veer assess the whole set etc.
<br>
<br>
but as man is part of the universe, he is also gioverned by the laws in it.

ALL his thoughts and actions (smae thing) must be governed by laws and therefore predictable.

Groups are different to predict.

because there are more people involved you may think that makes groups mpre complex to predict.

nope, they're easier.

Intel and AMD get a lot more competition from the computer already on your desk than they do from each other. To get you to buy Intel over AMD, they just need to be a little better. To get you to replace your perfectly functioning computer, they need to be a lot better. The companies working in software, networking, media, and other industries have the same simple motivation, and end up helping each other out because improvements in one area require improvements in another.</p></td>

While the main basics of Ray predictions are most questionable: estimate of the raw computational power of brain, on one side, and estimate of possible speed of computers, on other side.

As a result, as far as future goes, there is no way to tell, really.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>'What incentive is there for Intel to keep transistors doubling while keeping prices down at the same rate it has in the past?'
<br>
<br>
Well, Michio Kaku says that 'The wealth of nations depends upon the technology that will replace the power of silicon' by which he means 'the wealth of nations is dependent on the continuation of Moore's Law'. In other words, just because AMD drops out of the market, there are still plenty of other markets (indeed The Market or technology as a whole) that depend upon the continuation of Moore's Law. 
<br>
<br>
Another point is that the power of our information-processing capabilities always seems to hint at further capabilities if only we had a bit more processing power. I am sure that the scientific community etc has plenty of reasons for intel and other chip manufacturers to keep pusing towards the ultimate limits of information processing, whatever they may be.
<br>
<br>
Not sure that would mean if intel have the monopoly they would keep prices down or fixed at a constant level as their chips capability goes UP though :(
