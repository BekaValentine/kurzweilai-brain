<br><blockquote>The critical attitude may be described as the conscious attempt to make our theories, our conjectures, suffer in our stead in the struggle for the survival of the fittest. It gives us a chance to survive the elimination of an inadequate hypothesis - when a more dogmatic attitude would eliminate it by eliminating us.</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Sir KARL POPPER</blockquote>
<p>AS WE LOOK FORWARD to see where the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race leads, we should ask three questions. What is <i>possible</i>, what is <i>achievable</i>, and what is <i>desirable</i>?</p>
<p>&#160;First, where <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> is concerned, natural law sets limits to the possible. Because <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will open a path to those limits, understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s is a key to understanding what is possible.</p>
<p>&#160;Second, the principles of change and the facts of our present situation <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> limits to the achievable. Because evolving replicators will play a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> role, the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> are a key to understanding what will be achievable.</p>
<p>&#160;As for what is desirable or undesirable, our differing dreams spur a quest for a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> with room for <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>, while our shared fears spur a quest for a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of safety.</p>
<p>&#160;These three questions - of the possible, the achievable, and the desirable - frame an approach to foresight. First, scientific and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> form a map of the limits of the possible. Though still blurred and incomplete, this map outlines the permanent limits within which the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> must move. Second, <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary principles determine what paths lie open, and <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> limits to achievement - including lower limits, because advances that promise to improve <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> or to further <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> power will be virtually unstoppable. This allows a limited prediction: If the eons-old <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary race does not somehow screech to a halt, then competitive pressures will mold our technological <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> to the contours of the limits of the possible. Finally, within the broad confines of the possible and the achievable, we can try to reach a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> we find desirable. &#160;</p><h1>Pitfalls of Prophecy</h1><p>But how can anyone predict the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>? Political and economic trends are notoriously fickle, and sheer chance rolls dice across continents. Even the comparatively steady advance of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> often eludes prediction.</p>
<p>&#160;Prognosticators often guess at the times and costs required to harness new technologies. When they reach beyond outlining possibilities and attempt accurate predictions, they generally fail. For example, though the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttle was clearly possible, predictions of its cost and initial launch date were wrong by several years and billions of dollars. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers cannot accurately predict when a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will be developed, because development always involves uncertainties. &#160;</p>
<p>But we have to try to predict and guide development. Will we develop monster technologies before cage technologies, or after? Some monsters, once loosed, cannot be caged. To survive, we must keep control by speeding some developments and slowing others.</p>
<p>&#160;Though one <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> can sometimes block the dangers of another (defense vs. offense, pollution controls vs. pollution), competing technologies often go in the same direction. On December 29, 1959, <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> (now a Nobel laureate) gave a talk at an annual meeting of the American Physical Society entitled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom." He described a non-biochemical approach to nanomachinery (working down, step by step, using larger <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to build smaller <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s), and stated that the principles of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> do not speak against the possibility of maneuvering things <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> by <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>. It is not an attempt to violate any laws; it is something, in principle, that can be done; but, in practice, it has not been done because we are too big.... Ultimately, we can do chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>.... put the atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance." In brief, he sketched another, nonbiochemical path to the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>. He also stated, even then, that it is "a development which I think cannot be avoided."</p>
<p>&#160;As I will discuss in Chapters 4 and 5, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s and intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s will simplify many questions regarding the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and cost of technological developments. But questions of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and cost will still muddy our view of the period between the present and these breakthroughs. <a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> saw in 1959 that nanomachines could direct chemical <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>, presumably including the <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>. Yet he could foresee neither the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> nor the cost of doing so.</p>
<p>&#160;In fact, of course, biochemists developed techniques for making <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> without <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable nanomachines, using shortcuts based on specific chemical tricks. Winning technologies often succeed because of unobvious tricks and details. In the mid-1950s physicists could see that <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> principles made microcircuits physically possible, but foreseeing how they would be made - foreseeing the details of mask-making, resists, oxide <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, ion implantation, etching, and so forth, in all their <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> - would have been impossible. The nuances of detail and competitive advantage that select winning technologies make the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> race complex and its path unpredictable.</p>
<p>&#160;But does this make long-term forecasting futile? In a race toward the limits <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> by natural law, the finish line is predictable even if the path and the pace of the runners are not. Not <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> whims but the unchanging laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> draw the line between what is physically possible and what is not - no political act, no social movement can change the law of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> one whit. So however <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic they may seem, sound projections of technological possibilities are quite distinct from predictions. They rest on timeless laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>, not on the vagaries of events. &#160;</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that this insight remains rare. Without it, we stumble in a daze across the landscape of the possible, confusing mountains with mirages and discounting both. We look ahead with minds and cultures rooted in the ideas of more sluggish times, when both <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and technological competition lacked their present strength and speed. We have only recently begun to evolve a tradition of technological foresight. &#160;</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and Natural Law</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> intertwine. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers use <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> produced by scientists; scientists use tools produced by <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. Scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers both work with mathematical descriptions of natural laws and test ideas with experiments. But <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> differ radically in their basis, methods, and aims. Understanding these differences is crucial to sound foresight. Though both fields consist of evolving <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, they evolve under different pressures. Consider the roots of scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Through most of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, people had little understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. This left philosophers <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> that sensory evidence, through <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, must somehow imprint on the mind all <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-including <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of natural law. But in 1737, the Scottish philosopher David Hume presented them with a nasty puzzle: he showed that observations cannot logically prove a general rule, that the Sun shining day after day proves nothing, logically, about its shining tomorrow. And indeed, someday the Sun will fail, disproving any such <a class="thought" href="entries/logic_entry.html">logic</a>. Hume's problem appeared to destroy the idea of rational <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, greatly upsetting rational philosophers (including himself). They thrashed and sweated, and irrationalism gained ground. In 1945, philosopher Bertrand Russell observed that "the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of unreason throughout the nineteenth century and what has passed of the twentieth is a natural sequel to Hume's destruction of empiricism." Hume's problem-<a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> had undercut the very idea of rational <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, at least as people had imagined it.</p>
<p>&#160;In recent decades, Karl Popper (perhaps the scientists' favorite philosopher of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>), Thomas Kuhn, and others have recognized <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> as an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process. They see it not as a mechanical process by which observations somehow generate conclusions, but as a battle where ideas compete for acceptance.</p>
<p>&#160;All ideas, as memes, compete for acceptance, but the <a class="thought" href="entries/meme_entry.html">meme</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is special: it has a tradition of deliberate idea mutation, and a unique <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a> for controlling the mutants. The results of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> vary with the selective pressures applied, whether among test tube <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/insect_entry.html">insect</a>s, ideas, or <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">Hardware</a> evolved for refrigeration differs from <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> evolved for transportation, hence refrigerators make very poor cars. In general, replicators evolved for A differ from those evolved for B. Memes are no exception.</p>
<p>&#160;Broadly speaking, ideas can evolve to <i>seem</i> true or they can evolve to <i>be</i> true (by seeming true to people who check ideas carefully). Anthropologists and historians have described what happens when ideas evolve to <i>seem</i> true among people lacking the methods of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>; the results (the evil-<a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> theory of disease, the lights-on-a-dome theory of stars, and so forth) were fairly consistent worldwide. Psychologists probing people's naive misconceptions about how objects fall have found beliefs like those that evolved into formal "scientific" <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s during the Middle Ages, before the work of Galileo and Newton.</p>
<p>&#160;Galileo and Newton used experiments and observations to test ideas about objects and motion, beginning an era of dramatic scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>: Newton evolved a theory that survived every test then available. Their method of deliberate testing killed off ideas that strayed too far from the truth, including ideas that had evolved to appeal to the naive <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> mind.</p>
<p>&#160;This trend has continued. Further variation and testing have forced the further <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of scientific ideas, yielding some as bizarre-seeming as the varying <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and curved <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, or the probabilistic <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> functions of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. Even <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> has discarded the special <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-force expected by early biologists, revealing instead elaborate <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of invisibly small molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. Ideas evolved to <i>be</i> true (or close to the truth) have again and again turned out to <i>seem</i> false - or incomprehensible. The true and the true-seeming have turned out to be as different as cars and refrigerators.</p>
<p>&#160;Ideas in the physical <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s have evolved under several <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> selection rules. First, scientists ignore ideas that lack testable consequences; they thus keep their heads from being clogged by useless parasites. Second, scientists seek replacements for ideas that have failed tests. Finally, scientists seek ideas that make the widest possible range of exact predictions, The law of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, for example, describes how stones fall, <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a>, and galaxies swirl, and makes exact predictions that leave it wide open to disproof. Its breadth and precision likewise give it broad usefulness, helping <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers both to design bridges and to plan spaceflights.</p>
<p>&#160;The scientific community provides an environment where such memes spread, forced by competition and testing to evolve toward power and accuracy. Agreement on the importance of testing theories holds the scientific community together through fierce controversies over the theories themselves.</p>
<p>&#160;Inexact, limited evidence can never <i>prove</i> an exact, general theory (as Hume showed), but it can <i>disprove</i> some theories and so help scientists choose among them. Like other <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary processes, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> creates something positive (a growing store of useful theories) through a double negative (<i>dis</i>proof of <i>in</i>correct theories). The central role of negative evidence accounts for some of the mental upset caused by <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>: as an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of disproof, it can uproot cherished beliefs, leaving psychological voids that it need not refill.</p>
<p>&#160;In practical terms, of course, much scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is as solid as a rock dropped on your toe. We know <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a> circles the Sun (though our senses suggest otherwise) because the theory fits endless observations, and because we know why our senses are fooled. We have more than a mere theory that atoms exist: we have bonded them to form <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, tickled <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a> from them, seen them under microscopes (barely), and smashed them to pieces. We have more than a mere theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>: we have observed mutations, observed selection, and observed <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in the laboratory. We have found the traces of past <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> in our <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>'s rocks, and have observed <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> shaping our tools, our minds, and the ideas in our minds - including the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> itself. The process of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> has hammered out a unified explanation of many facts, including how people and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> themselves came to be.</p>
<p>&#160;When <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> finishes disproving theories, the survivors often huddle so close together that the gap between them makes no practical difference. After all, a practical difference between two surviving theories could be tested and used to disprove one of them. The differences among modern theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, for instance, are far too subtle to trouble <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers who are planning flights through the <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> fields of <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a>. In fact, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers plan spaceflights using Newton's disproved theory because it is simpler than Einstein's, and is accurate enough. Einstein's theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> has survived all tests so far, yet there is no absolute proof for it and there never will be. His theory makes exact predictions about everything everywhere (at least about gravitational <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>s), but scientists can only make approximate measurements of some things somewhere. And, as Karl Popper points out, one can always invent a theory so similar to another that existing evidence cannot tell them apart.</p>
<p>&#160;Though <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> debates highlight the shaky, disputed borders of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> to build agreement remains clear. Where else has agreement on so much grown so steadily and so internationally? Surely not in <a class="thought" href="entries/politics_entry.html">politics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, or <a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a>. Indeed, the chief rival of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> is a relative: <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering, which also evolves through proposals and rigorous testing. &#160;</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> VS. <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a></h1><p>As <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> Director of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Ralph E. Gomory says, "The <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> development is often confused with <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> in the public mind." This confusion muddles our efforts at foresight.</p>
<p>&#160;Though <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers often tread uncertain ground, they are not doomed to do so, as scientists are. They can escape the inherent risks of proposing precise, universal scientific theories. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers need only show that under <i>particular</i> conditions <i>particular</i> objects will perform <i>well enough</i>. A designer need know neither the exact stress in a suspension bridge cable nor the exact stress that will break it; the cable will support the bridge so long as the first remains below the second, whatever they may be.</p>
<p>&#160;Though measurements cannot prove precise equality, they <i>can</i> prove inequality. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering results can thus be solid in a way that precise scientific theories cannot. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ering results can even survive disproof of the scientific theories supporting them, when the new theory gives similar results. The case for <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s, for example, will survive any possible refinements in our theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a> and molecular bonds.</p>
<p>&#160;Predicting the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> of new scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is logically impossible because it makes no <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to claim to <i>know</i> already the facts you will <i>learn</i> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Predicting the details of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, on the other hand, is merely difficult. <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> aims at knowing, but <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering aims at doing; this lets <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers speak of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> achievements without paradox. They can evolve their <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> in the world of mind and <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, before cutting metal or even filling in all the details of a design.</p>
<p>&#160;Scientists commonly recognize this difference between scientific foresight and technological foresight: they readily make <i>technological</i> predictions about <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. Scientists could and did predict the quality of Voyager's pictures of Saturn's rings, for example, though not their surprising <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. Indeed, they predicted the pictures' quality while the cameras were as yet mere ideas and drawings. Their calculations used well-tested principles of optics, involving no new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Because <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> aims to understand how everything works, scientific training can be a great aid in understanding specific pieces of <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. Still, it does not automatically bring <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering expertise; designing an airliner requires much more than a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s of metallurgy and aerodynamics.</p>
<p>&#160;Scientists are encouraged by their colleagues and their training to focus on ideas that can be tested with available apparatus. The resulting short-term focus often serves <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> well: it keeps scientists from wandering off into foggy worlds of untested fantasy, and swift testing makes for an efficient mental <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>. Regrettably, though, this cultural bias toward short-term testing may make scientists less interested in long-term advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;The impossibility of genuine foresight regarding <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> leads many scientists to regard all statements about <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments as "speculative" - a term that makes perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> when applied to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, but little <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> when applied to well-grounded projections in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. But most <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers share similar leanings toward the short term. They too are encouraged by their training, colleagues, and employers to focus on just one kind of problem: the design of <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that can be made with present <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> or with <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> just around the corner. Even long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering projects like the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> shuttle must have a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> cutoff date after which no new developments can become part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> design of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;In brief, scientists refuse to predict <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, and seldom discuss <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering developments. <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers do project <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> developments, but seldom discuss any not based on present abilities. Yet this leaves a crucial gap: what of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering developments firmly based on <i>present</i> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> but awaiting <i><a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> abilities</i>? This gap leaves a fruitful area for study.</p>
<p>&#160;Imagine a line of development which involves using existing tools to build new tools, then using <i>those</i> tools to build <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> (perhaps including yet another generation of tools). Each <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of tools may rest on established principles, yet the whole development sequence may take many years, as each step brings a host of specific problems to iron out. Scientists planning their next experiment and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers designing their next <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> may well ignore all but the first step. Still, the end result may be foreseeable, lying well within the bounds of the possible shown by established <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>&#160;Recent <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> illustrates this pattern. Few <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers considered building <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> stations before rockets reached <a class="thought" href="entries/orbit_entry.html">orbit</a>, but the principles were clear enough, and <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering is now a thriving field. Similarly, few mathematicians and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers studied the possibilities of <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a> until <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s were built, though many did afterward. So it is not too surprising that few scientists and <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers have yet examined the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, however important it may become. &#160;</p><h1>The Lesson of Leonardo</h1><p>Efforts to project <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering developments have a long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, and past examples illustrate present possibilities. For example, how did <a class="thought" href="entries/da_vinci_entry.html">Leonardo da Vinci</a> succeed in foreseeing so much, and why did he sometimes fail?</p>
<p>&#160;Leonardo lived five hundred years ago, his <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> spanning the discovery of the New World. He made projections in the form of drawings and <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s; each design may be seen as a projection that something much like it could be made to work. He succeeded as a mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er: he designed workable <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s (some were not to be built for centuries) for excavating, metalworking, transmitting power, and other purposes. He failed as an aircraft <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er: we now know that his flying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s could never be made to work as described.</p>
<p>&#160;His successes at <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> design are easy to understand. If parts can be made accurately enough, of a hard enough, strong enough material, then the design of slow-moving <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with levers, pulleys, and rolling bearings becomes a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> and leverage. Leonardo understood these quite well. Some of his "predictions" were long-range, but only because many years passed before people learned to make parts precise enough, hard enough, and strong enough to build (for instance) good ball bearings - their use came some three hundred years after Leonardo proposed them. Similarly, gears with superior, cycloidal teeth went unmade for almost two centuries after Leonardo drew them, and one of his chain-drive designs went unbuilt for almost three centuries.</p>
<p>&#160;His failures with aircraft are also easy to understand. Because Leonardo's age lacked a <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of aerodynamics, he could neither calculate the forces on wings nor know the requirements for aircraft power and control.</p>
<p>&#160;Can people in our <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> hope to make projections regarding molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s as accurate as those <a class="thought" href="entries/da_vinci_entry.html">Leonardo da Vinci</a> made regarding metal <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? Can we avoid errors like those in his plans for flying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s? Leonardo's example suggests that we can. It may help to remember that Leonardo himself probably lacked confidence in his aircraft, and that his errors nonetheless held a germ of truth. He was right to believe that flying <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of some sort were possible-indeed, he could be certain of it because they already existed. Birds, bats, and bees proved the possibility of flight. Further, though there were no working examples of his ball bearings, gears, and chain drives, he could have confidence in their principles. Able minds had already built a broad foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> and the laws of leverage. The required strength and accuracy of the parts may have caused him doubt, but not their interplay of function and motion. Leonardo could propose <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s requiring better parts than any then known, and still have a measure of confidence in his designs.</p>
<p>&#160;Proposed molecular technologies likewise rest on a broad foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>, not only of <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> and leverage, but of chemical bonding, statistical mechanics, and <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> in general. This <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, though, the problems of material properties and fabrication accuracy do not arise in any separate way. The properties of atoms and bonds <i>are</i> the material properties, and atoms come prefabricated and perfectly standardized. Thus we now seem better prepared for foresight than were people in Leonardo's time: we know more about <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and controlled bonding than they knew about steel and precision machining. In addition, we can point to nanomachines that already exist in the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> as Leonardo could point to the <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s (birds) already flying in the sky.</p>
<p>&#160;Projecting how second-generation nanomachines can be built by <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s is surely easier than it was to project how precise steel <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s would be built starting with the cruder <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s of Leonardo's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">Learning</a> to use crude <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to make more precise <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s was bound to take <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and the methods were far from obvious. Molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, in contrast, will be built from identical prefabricated atomic parts which need only be assembled. Making precise <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s with crooked <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s must have been harder to imagine then than molecular assembly is now. And besides, we know that molecular assembly happens all the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Again, we have firmer grounds for confidence than Leonardo did.</p>
<p>&#160;In Leonardo's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, people had scant <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of electricity and magnetism, and knew nothing of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/quantum_mechanics_entry.html">quantum mechanics</a>. Accordingly, electric lights, radios, and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s would have baffled them. Today, however, the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> laws most important to <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering - those describing normal <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> - seem well understood. As with surviving theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>, the scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of disproof has forced surviving theories of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> into close agreement.</p>
<p>&#160;Such <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> is recent. Before this century people did not understand why solids were solid or why the Sun shone. Scientists did not understand the laws that governed <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the ordinary world of <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, people, <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>s, and stars. This is why our century has sprouted <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/hydrogen_entry.html">hydrogen</a> bombs, and why molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> draws near. This <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> brings new hopes and dangers, but at least it gives us the means to see ahead and to prepare.</p>
<p>&#160;When the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> laws of a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are known, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> possibilities can be foreseen (though with gaps, or Leonardo would have foreseen mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s). Even when the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> laws are poorly known, as were the principles of aerodynamics in Leonardo's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> can demonstrate possibilities. Finally, when both <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> point to a possibility, these lessons suggest that we take it to heart and plan accordingly. &#160;</p><h1>The <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">Assembler</a> Breakthrough</h1><p>The foundations of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> may evolve and shift, yet they will continue to support a steady, growing edifice of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering knowhow. Eventually, <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s will allow <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to make whatever can be designed, sidestepping the traditional problems of materials and fabrication. Already, approximations and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> models allow <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers to evolve designs even in the absence of the tools required to implement them. All this will combine to permit foresight - and something more.</p>
<p>&#160;As <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> advances, there will come a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s become an imminent prospect, backed by an earnest and well-funded development <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Their expected capabilities will have become clear.</p>
<p>&#160;By then, <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-aided design of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s - which has already begun - will have grown common and sophisticated, spurred by advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and the growing needs of molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers. Using these design tools, <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be able to design second-generation nanosystems, including the second-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s needed to build them. What is more, by allowing enough margin for inaccuracies (and by preparing alternative designs), <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers will be able to design many <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that will work when first built - they will have evolved sound designs in a world of simulated <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s.</p>
<p>&#160;Consider the force of this situation: under development will be the greatest production tool in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>, a truly general fabrication <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> able to make anything that can be designed - and a design <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will already be in hand. Will everyone wait until <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s appear before planning how to use them? Or will companies and countries respond to the pressures of opportunity and competition by designing nanosystems in advance, to speed the exploitation of <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a>s when they first arrive?</p>
<p>&#160;This <i>design-ahead</i> process seems sure to occur; the only question is when it will start and how far it will go. Years of quiet design <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> may well erupt into <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> with unprecedented suddenness in the wake of the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough. How well we design ahead - and what we design - may determine whether we survive and thrive, or whether we obliterate ourselves.</p>
<p>&#160;Because the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough will affect almost the whole of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, foresight is an enormous task. Of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of possible mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s, Leonardo foresaw only a few. Similarly, of the far broader <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> technologies, modern minds can foresee only a few. A few advances, however, seem of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> importance.</p>
<p>&#160;Medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> frontier, advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, and new social <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s all promise to play interlocking roles. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/assembler_entry.html">assembler</a> breakthrough will affect all of them, and more.</p>
