<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p>There used to be quite a demand for psychic mediums who would go 
              into "<a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> cabinets" and channel fields to contact lost souls 
              who would communicate by making sounds. In my lab, once we had developed 
              the techniques to induce and measure weak electric fields around 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, we realized that we could make a modern-day <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> 
              cabinet (well, everything but the lost souls part). So of course 
              we had to do a magic trick, which we were soon working on with the 
              magicians Penn &amp; Teller, who were planning a small opera with 
              Tod Machover. We expected to have fun; we didn't expect to save 
              the lives of infants, or learn something about how industry and 
              academia can remove technological barriers by removing organizational 
              barriers.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> for our <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> cabinet was developed by Joe Paradiso, 
              a former <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> physicist who in his spare <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> builds 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>s that look just like enormous <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> 
              detectors. Joe designed a seat that radiates a field out through 
              the medium's body, and from that can invisibly measure the smallest 
              gestures. Tod shaped a composition for it, and Penn &amp; Teller 
              toured with it.</p>
<p>The trick worked technically, but it ran into an unexpected artistic 
              problem: audiences had a hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> believing that the performers 
              created rather than responded to the sounds. <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">Science fiction</a> had 
              prepared them to believe in hyperspace travel but not in a working 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> cabinet. It was only by sitting people in the chair that 
              we could convince them that it did work; at that point we had a 
              hard <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> getting them back out of it.</p>
<p>I saw this project as an entertaining exercise for the physical 
              models and <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ation that we were developing to look at fields 
              around bodies, not as anything particularly useful. The last thing 
              I expected was to see it turn into an automotive safety product. 
              But after we showed it, I found a <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab sponsor, Phil Rittmueller 
              from NEC, in my lab telling me about child seats. NEC makes the 
              controllers for airbags, and they were all too familiar with a story 
              that was about to hit the popular press: infants in rear-facing 
              child seats were being injured and killed by airbags. Deaths were 
              going to result from leaving the airbags on, and also from <a class="thought" href="entries/switch_entry.html">switch</a>ing 
              them off. Finding a way for a smart airbag to recognize and respond 
              appropriately to the seat occupant was a <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>-and-<a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> question 
              for the industry.</p>
<p>No one knew how to do it. To decide when to fire, the seat needed 
              to distinguish among a child facing forward, a child facing reverse, 
              a small adult, and a bag of groceries. Under pressure to act, the 
              National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was about to mandate 
              a standard for disabling the airbag based on the weight of the occupant, 
              an arbitrary threshold that would be sure to make mistakes. The 
              only working alternative imposed the unrealistic requirement that 
              all child seats had to have special sensor tags installed in them.</p>
<p>Phil wondered if our fancy seat could recognize infants as well 
              as magicians. My student Josh Smith veered off from what he was 
              doing for a few weeks to put together a prototype, and to our very 
              pleasant surprise it not only worked, it appeared to outperform 
              anything being considered by the auto industry. After NEC showed 
              the prototype to some car companies they wanted to know when they 
              could buy it. NEC has since announced the product, the Passenger 
              Sensing <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like an ordinary automobile seat. Flexible electrodes 
              in the seat emit and detect very weak electric fields, much like 
              the weak fields given off from the cord of a stereo headphone. A 
              controller interprets these signals to effectively see the three&#173;dimensional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> of the seat occupant, and uses these <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> to determine 
              how to fire the airbag. The <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> is that it's invisible 
              and requires no attention; all the passenger has to do is sit in 
              the seat. Although the immediate application is to disable the airbag 
              for rear-facing infant seats, in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> will be used 
              to control the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> of an airbag based on the location of the 
              occupant, and more generally help the car respond to the state of 
              the occupant.</p>
<p>Now I would never have taken funding for automobile seat safety 
              development&#8212;it's too remote from what I do, and too narrow. 
              NEC would never have supported magic tricks internally&#8212;it's 
              too remote from what they do, and too crazy. Yet by putting these 
              pieces together, the result was something unambiguously useful that 
              we probably could not have gotten to any other way. This is one 
              of the secrets of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab works with industrial sponsors: 
              maximize contact, not <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s.</p>
<p>That's what much of academia and industry carefully prevent. The 
              organization of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development in the United States can 
              be directly traced to an influential report that <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a> wrote 
              for Franklin Roosevelt in 1945.</p>
<p>Two technologies developed during World War II arguably ended the 
              conflict, first radar and then nuclear bombs. These were created 
              under the auspices of the then-secret Office of Scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> 
              and Development, directed by <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a>. After the war President 
              Roosevelt asked him to figure out how to sustain that pace of development 
              for peacetime goals, including combating <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and creating jobs 
              in new industries.</p>
<p>The resulting report, <i><a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a>&#8212;The Endless Frontier</i>, 
              argued that the key was <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> support of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. Both 
              nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s and radar were largely a consequence of fundamental 
              studies of the <a class="thought" href="entries/subatomic_entry.html">subatomic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>, the former directly 
              from nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, and the latter through the <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s that 
              had been developed for <a class="thought" href="entries/nmr_entry.html">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s. Just 
              when <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> emerged as a key to economic competitiveness 
              after the war, the country was facing a shortage of scientists and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers who could do the work. Attracting and training them would 
              be essential.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a> proposed that the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>'s postwar role should 
              be to fund curiosity-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> studies. These should 
              be done externally, at universities and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> institutes, and 
              be evaluated solely with regard to their scientific merit without 
              any concern for practical applications. Since the direction of true 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> can never be predicted, the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> would provide 
              long-term grants, awarded based on the promise and record of a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              project rather than claims of expected outcomes of the work. <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a>ers 
              doing solid work could expect steady funding.</p>
<p>The useful fruits of the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> would then be picked up 
              by applied <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> laboratories. Here the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> would have 
              a stronger role, both through the work of its own agencies, and 
              through fostering a regulatory climate that encouraged industry 
              to do the same. Finally, the applied results would move to industry 
              where product development would be done.</p>
<p>He proposed the creation of a new agency to support all <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, the National <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Foundation. By the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> the enabling 
              legislations was passed in 1950 the title had changed to the National 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Foundation (NSF) since there were too many entrenched <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> 
              interests unwilling to cede control in areas other than <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> that a staff of about fifty people and a budget 
              of $20 million a year should be sufficient to do the job.</p>
<p>In 1997 the NSF had twelve hundred employees and a budget of $3 
              billion a year. Attracting new scientists is no longer a problem; 
              finding <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> jobs for them is. The NSF gets so many proposals 
              from so many people that simply doing great work is no longer sufficient 
              to ensure adequate, stable, long-term funding. <a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> 
              is straining under the weight of its own successful creation of 
              an enormous academic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> establishment.</p>
<p>It's also struggling to cope with the consequences of the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> 
              of the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>. The original proposal for the National 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Foundation recognized that <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is too unlike any other 
              kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> function to be managed in the same way; grantees 
              would need the <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> to organize and administer themselves as 
              they saw fit. The usual <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> bidding and accounting rules 
              would have to be relaxed to encourage <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>.</p>
<p>Not that the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> has been particularly successful at overseeing 
              itself. The shocking inefficiency of the federal bureaucracy led 
              to the passage in 1993 of the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">Government</a> Performance and Results 
              Act. GPRA sought to bring industrial standards of accountability 
              to bear on the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, forcing agencies to develop clear strategic 
              plans with measurable performance targets, and basing <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> budgetary 
              obligations on the value delivered to the agencies' customers.</p>
<p>This means that the U.S. <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> is now in the business of producing 
              five-year plans with production targets, just as the former Soviet 
              Union has given up on the idea as being hopelessly unrealistic. 
              GPRA applies to the NSF, and its grantees, and so they must do the 
              same. Therefore a <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> proposal now has to include annual 
              milestones and measurable performance targets for the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. 
              My industrial sponsors would never ask me to do that. If I could 
              tell them exactly what I was going to deliver each year for the 
              next five years then I wouldn't be doing <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, I would be doing 
              development that they could better perform internally.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> out to protect <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> from the pressure to 
              deliver practical applications, freeing it to go wherever the quest 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> leads. GPRA seeks to nail <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to applications, 
              asking to be told up front what a project is useful for. Both are 
              good-faith attempts to derive practical benefits from <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> funding, 
              and both miss the way that so much innovation really happens.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a>'s legacy was felt at <a class="thought" href="entries/bell_labs_entry.html">Bell Labs</a> when I was there before 
              the breakup of the phone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> in the 1980s. The building was split 
              into two wings, with a neutral zone in the middle. Building 1 was 
              where the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> happened. This was where the best and the 
              brightest went, the past and <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> Nobel laureates. The relevant 
              indicator of performance was the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of articles in the prestigious 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> journal that publishes short letters, a scientific kind 
              of sound bite. Building 2 did development, an activity that was 
              seen as less pure from over in Building 1. This didn't lead to Nobel 
              prizes or <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> letters. Conversely Building 1, viewed from Building 
              2, was seen as arrogant and out of touch with the world. The cafeteria 
              was between the buildings, but the two camps generally stuck to 
              their sides of the lunchroom. Meanwhile, the business units of the 
              telephone company saw much of the whole enterprise as being remote 
              from their concerns, and <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up their own development organizations. 
              Very few ideas ever made it from Building 1 to Building 2 to a product.</p>
<p>There were still plenty of successes to point to, the most famous 
              being the <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>. But this happened in exactly 
              the reverse direction. The impetus behind the discovery of the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              was not curiosity-driven <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, it was the need to replace 
              unreliable <a class="thought" href="entries/vacuum_tube_entry.html">vacuum tube</a>s in amplifiers in the phone <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. It was 
              only after the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> had been found that explaining how it 
              worked presented a range of fundamental <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> questions that 
              kept Building 1 employed for the next few decades.</p>
<p>Few scientific discoveries ever spring from free inquiry alone. 
              Take the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of one of my favorite <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s, <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>. In the 
              mid-1800s steam power was increasingly <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant as the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> of 
              industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, but there was very little understanding of 
              the performance limits on a steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> that could guide the development 
              of more efficient ones. This practical problem led Rudolf Clausius 
              in 1854 to introduce <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a>, defined to be the change in heat flowing 
              into or out of a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, divided by the temperature. He found that 
              it always increases, with the increase approaching zero in a perfect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. Here now was a useful test to see how much a particular 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> might be improved. This study has grown into the modern subject 
              of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> prompted a quest to find a microscopic explanation 
              for the macroscopic definition. This was provided by Ludwig Boltzmann 
              in 1877 as the logarithm of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of different <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a>s 
              that a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> can be in. By analyzing the possible ways to arrange 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s in a gas, he was able to show that his definition 
              matched Clausius's. This theory provided the needed connection between 
              the performance of a heat <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> and the properties of the gas, 
              but it also contained a disturbing loophole that Maxwell soon noticed.</p>
<p>An intelligent and devious little creature (which he called a demon) 
              could judiciously open and close a tiny door between two sides of 
              a box, thereby separating the hot from the cold gas <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s, which 
              could then run an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. Repeating this procedure would provide 
              a perpetual-<a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, a desirable if impossible outcome. Many 
              people spent many years unsuccessfully trying to exorcise Maxwell's 
              demon. An <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant step came in 1929 when Leo Szilard reduced the 
              problem to its essence with a single <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a> that could be on either 
              side of a partition. While he wasn't able to solve the demon <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>, 
              this introduced the notion of a "<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a>" of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>.</p>
<p>Szilard's one-<a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> analysis of Maxwell's demon provided the inspiration 
              for Claude Shannon's theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> in 1948. Just as the 
              steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> powered the <a class="thought" href="entries/industrial_revolution_entry.html">Industrial Revolution</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s 
              was powering an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> revolution. And just as finding the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of a steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a> was a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of some industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>, 
              the growing demand for <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s links required an understanding 
              of how many messages could be sent through a wire. Thanks to Szilard, 
              Shannon realized that <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> could measure the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> of a telephone 
              wire as well as an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. He created a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that 
              could find the performance limit of a <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s channel. His 
              theory led to a remarkable conclusion: as long as the <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> rate 
              is below this <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a>, it is possible to communicate without any 
              errors. This result more than any other is responsible for the perfect 
              fidelity that we now take for granted in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s.</p>
<p>Maxwell's demon survived until the 1960s, when Rolf Landauer at 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> related <a class="thought" href="entries/information_theory_entry.html">information theory</a> back to its roots in thermodynamics 
              and showed that the demon ceases to be a perpetual-<a class="thought" href="entries/motion_entry.html">motion</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> 
              when its <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> is included in the accounting. As long as the demon 
              never forgets its <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s they can be undone; erasing its <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a> 
              acts very much like the cycling of a piston in a steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>. Rolf's 
              colleague Charles Bennett was able to extend this intriguing connection 
              between <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> to computing, showing that it is possible 
              to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that in theory uses as little <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> as you 
              wish, as long as you are willing to wait long enough to get a correct 
              answer.</p>
<p>Rolf and Charles's work was seen as beautiful theory but remote 
              from application until this decade, when power consumption suddenly 
              became a very serious limit on computing. <a class="thought" href="entries/supercomputer_entry.html">Supercomputer</a>s use so 
              much power that it's hard to keep them from melting; so many PCs 
              are going into office buildings that the electrical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s cannot 
              handle the load; and portable <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s need to be recharged much 
              too often. As with steam <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> links, <a class="thought" href="entries/entropy_entry.html">entropy</a> 
              provided a way to measure the <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> efficiency of a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and 
              guide optimizations. Lower-power chips are now being designed based 
              on these principles.</p>
<p>This <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> touches on fundamental theory (the microscopic explanation 
              of macroscopic behavior), practical applications (efficient <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>s), 
              far-reaching implications (<a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s), and even the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> (the physical limits on <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>). Yet 
              which part is <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>, and which is applied? Which led to which? The 
              question can't be answered, and isn't particularly relevant. The 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of a good idea rarely honors these distinctions.</p>
<p>The presumed pathway from <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to applications operates 
              at least as often in the opposite direction. I found out how to 
              make molecular quantum <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s only by trying to solve the short-term 
              challenge of making cheap chips. If I had been protected to pursue 
              my <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> agenda I never would have gotten there. And the 
              converse of the common academic assumption that short-term applications 
              should be kept at a distance from <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is the industrial 
              expectation that long-term <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> is remote from short-term applications.</p>
<p>A newly minted product manager once told me that he had no need 
              for <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> because he was only making consumer <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s, even 
              though his group wanted to build a <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">Global Positioning System</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a>) 
              receiver into their product. <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> lets a portable <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> know exactly 
              where it is in the world, so that for example a camera can keep 
              track of where each picture was taken. It works by measuring the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> it takes a signal to reach the receiver from a constellation 
              of satellites. This requires synchronizing the clocks on all of 
              the satellites to a billionth of a second. To measure <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that 
              precisely, each satellite uses an atomic clock that tells <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> by 
              detecting the oscillation of an <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> in a magnetic field. According 
              to Einstein's theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> slows down as things move 
              faster, and as <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> strengthens. These effects are usually far 
              too small to see in ordinary <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, but <a class="thought" href="entries/gps_entry.html">GPS</a> measures <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> so 
              finely that the relativistic corrections are essential to its <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>. 
              So what looks like a simple consumer appliance depends on our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              of the laws governing both the very smallest and largest parts of 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>.</p>
<p>Across this divide between the short and long term, a battle is 
              now being fought over the desirability of <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> versus applied <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. 
              The doers of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> feel that they've honored their part of the 
              bargain, producing a steady stream of solid results from <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              radios to nuclear bombs, and cannot understand why the continuing 
              funding is not forthcoming. The users of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> results find that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> community is pursuing increasingly obscure topics removed 
              from their needs, and question the value of further support.</p>
<p>As a result both academic and industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> are now struggling 
              for funding. Many of the problems that inspired the creation of 
              the postwar <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> establishment have gone away. The most fundamental 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s have been the studies at giant <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> accelerators 
              of the smallest <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a>; these were funded by the Department 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> rather than the National <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Foundation for an interesting 
              historical <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>.</p>
<p>After World War II the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers who developed the nuclear bomb 
              were clearly of great strategic value for the country, but few wanted 
              to keep working for the <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a>. So Oppenheimer made a deal for 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> to fund <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to keep the community 
              together and the skills active, with the understanding that it might 
              be tapped as needed for <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> needs. The Department of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> then grew out of the Atomic <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Agency, the postwar <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up to deal with all things nuclear. Now with the end of the 
              cold war the demand for nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s is not what it used to be. 
              At the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>s have reached a scale 
              that new accelerators can no longer be afforded by a single country, 
              if not a whole <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>. Further scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> cannot come easily 
              the way it used to, by moving to ever-higher energies to reach ever-finer 
              scales. So there are now a lot of high&#173;energy physicists looking 
              for work.</p>
<p>Similarly, the original success of the <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> posed many <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              questions about how to make them smaller, faster, quieter. These 
              have largely been solved; an inexpensive child's toy can now contain 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> with a million perfect <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s. There is still an army 
              of physicists studying them, however, even though we understand 
              just about everything there is to know about a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>, and can 
              make them do most everything we want them to.</p>
<p>What's happened is that disciplines have come to be defined by 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of application, rather than their mode of inquiry. 
              The same equations govern how an <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a> moves in a <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a> 
              and in a person. Studying them requires the same <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Yet 
              when my lab started investigating the latter, to make furniture 
              that can see and shoes that can communicate, along with all of the 
              interest I was also asked whether it was real <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>. This is a 
              strange question. I can answer it, dissecting out the <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> piece 
              from the broader project. But I don't want to. I'd much rather be 
              asked about what I learned, how it relates to what is known, and 
              what its implications are.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/bush_entry.html">Vannevar Bush</a>'s <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> model dates back to an era of unlimited 
              faith in industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a>, and it is just as dated. Factories 
              were once designed around an assembly line, starting from raw materials 
              and sequentially adding <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s until the product was complete. 
              More recently it's been rediscovered that people, and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, 
              work better in flexible groups that can adapt to problems and opportunities 
              without having to disrupt the work flow. Similarly, there is a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              in which a conveyor belt is <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> to carry ideas from <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> 
              to applied <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> to development to productization to manufacturing 
              to marketing. The collision between bits and atoms is a disruption 
              in this assembly line that cries out for a new way to organize inquiry.</p>
<p>Joe Paradiso turning an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a> into a magic trick, and Phil 
              Rittmueller turning that into an auto safety product, provide a 
              clue for where to look. A secret of how the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab operates is 
              traffic: there are three or four groups in the building every day. 
              We're doing demos incessantly. This never happens in academia, because 
              it is seen as an inappropriate intrusion into free inquiry. And 
              it's not done in industry, where <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of internal projects 
              is carefully limited to those with a need to know. Both sides divide 
              a whole into pieces that add up to much less.</p>
<p>The companies can come in and tell us when we've done something 
              useful, like the car seat. They can do that far better than we can. 
              And, they can pose what they think are hard problems, which we may 
              in fact know how to solve. Instead of writing grant proposals I 
              see visitors, something that I would much rather do since I learn 
              so much from them. After helping them with what I know now, I can 
              use their support to work on problems that would be hard to justify 
              to any kind of funding agency. Ted Adelson nicely captures this 
              in a simple <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><img height="130" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050221103152im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/Gershenfield-WTSTT-Matrix Image(version2).gif" width="304"></p>
<p><i>Looks-easy-is-easy</i> questions do not need <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. <i>Looks-hard-is-hard</i> 
              is the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of grand challenges such as the <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that 
              require enormous resources and very long-term commitments. <i>Looks-hard-is-easy</i> 
              are the short-term problems that are easy to convey in a demo and 
              to relate to an application. <i>Looks-easy-is-hard</i> are the elusive 
              problems that really motivate us, like figuring out how <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              can have <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a>. It's difficult to explain why and how we 
              do them, and hence is hard to show them in a demo. The lower-left 
              corner pays the bills for the upper right, openly stealing from 
              the rich projects to pay for the poor ones.</p>
<p>The third trick that makes this work is the treatment of intellectual 
              property, the <a class="thought" href="entries/patent_entry.html">patent</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/copyright_entry.html">copyright</a>s that result from <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. 
              Academia and industry both usually seek to control them to wring 
              out the maximum revenue. But instead of giving one sponsor sole 
              rights to the result of one project, our sponsors trade exclusivity 
              for royalty-free rights to everything we do. This lets us and them 
              work together without worrying about who owns what. It's less of 
              a sacrifice for us than it might sound, because very few <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>s 
              ever make much money from licensing <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a>, but fights 
              over <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> regularly make many people miserable. 
              And it's less of a sacrifice for the sponsors than it might sound, 
              because they leverage their investment in any one area with all 
              of the other work going on. When they first arrive they're very 
              concerned about protecting all of their secrets; once they notice 
              that many of their secrets have preceded them and are already familiar 
              to us, and that we can solve many of their internal problems, they 
              relax and find that they get much more in return by being open.</p>
<p>The cost of their sponsorship is typically about the same for them 
              as adding one new employee; there are very few people who can match 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a> of a building full of enthusiastic, unconstrained 
              students, and it's hard for the companies to find and hire those 
              people. Any one thing we do the sponsors can do better if they really 
              want to, because they can throw much greater resources at a problem. 
              The difficult thing is figuring out where to put those resources. 
              We can happily learn from failing on nine projects, something that 
              would bankrupt a company, and then hand off the tenth that succeeds.</p>
<p>This relationship in turn depends on another trick. We have a floor 
              of people who wear suits and write memos and generally act <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a>. 
              This is essential to translate between the two cultures. Most every 
              day I see industrial visitors asking to fund <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, even 
              though they don't realize that's what they are saying. They're posing 
              problems without knowing where to look for solutions. It's unrealistic 
              to expect them to come in understanding what disciplines are relevant, 
              and how to work with them.</p>
<p>Sponsors as well as students need training. I realized this when 
              a company visited, was excited by what they saw and became a sponsor, 
              and just as quickly terminated their support, explaining that we 
              were not delivering products in a timely fashion. The real fault 
              lay not with them for so completely missing what a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> lab 
              is for, but with us for not recognizing and correcting their misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, I've come to find that I like to work equally well with 
              Nobel laureate scientists, virtuosic musicians, and good product 
              managers. They share a remarkably similar sensibility. They have 
              a great passion to create, bring enormous discipline to the task, 
              and have a finely honed <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of what is good and what is bad.</p>
<p>While their approaches overlap, their training and professional 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> do not. Mastery of one helps little with another. Yet 
              this is exactly what companies presume when they look to their <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers 
              to find applications for their work. I was visiting a large <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              company once that was trying to direct its <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> division to 
              be more useful. They did this by setting up a meeting that was more 
              like a religious revival, where <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers were asked to come forward 
              and testify with product plans. Not surprisingly, the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers 
              didn't have a clue. It takes an unusual combination of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              and disposition to excel at perceiving market opportunities and 
              relating them to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> capabilities.</p>
<p>In between the successful scientist, artist, and manager is a broad 
              middle ground where work does not answer to a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> discipline, 
              or a critical community, or the marketplace. <a class="thought" href="entries/negroponte_entry.html">Nicholas Negroponte</a> 
              and I spent a morning attending a <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> presentation at an industrial 
              lab along with the company's chain of command. After a laborious 
              discussion of their <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>, exactly how they went about designing 
              and evaluating their project, they finally showed what they did. 
              Nicholas was livid&amp;#8212an undergraduate could (and in fact did) 
              accomplish the same thing in a few afternoons. He couldn't believe 
              the waste of everyone's <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Amid all their process they had forgotten 
              to actually <i>do</i> something. Because the same group of people 
              were posing the question, doing the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, and evaluating the 
              results, that message never reached them.</p>
<p>This is one more <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> why demos are so <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant. They provide 
              a grounding that is taken for granted in a mature field but that 
              otherwise would be lacking in an emerging area. A steady stream 
              of visitors offers a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> check that can help catch both bad 
              and good ideas. This is a stretch for <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> cultures based around 
              carefully controlling <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, a protective reaction that can cause 
              more harm than good in rapidly changing fields. I've seen <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> labs that require management approval even for <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>, limiting it to those employees who can show a job-related 
              need to communicate. This distinction makes about as much <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> 
              as asking which employees have a job-related need to breathe; not 
              surprisingly it keeps out much more <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> than it lets in.</p>
<p>Demos serve one more essential function. Our students spend so 
              much <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> telling people what they're doing that they get good at 
              communicating it to varied audiences, an essential skill lacking 
              in most of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>. And then eventually, after doing it long enough, 
              they start to figure out for themselves what they're really doing. 
              One of my former students told me that he found this to be the single 
              most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant part of his <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, giving him an unfair advantage 
              in his new lab because none of his colleagues had <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> talking 
              to nonscientists about their work.</p>
<p>Too much <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> organization is a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/constraint_entry.html">constraint</a>s, trying 
              to decide who should do what. The sensible alternative that is regularly 
              overlooked is contact, trying to bring together problems and solutions. 
              Since the obvious connections have long since been found, this entails 
              finding the non-obvious ones like the car seat that would not show 
              up on a project list. The only successful way I've ever seen to 
              do this is through regular visits that allow each side to meet the 
              other.</p>
<p>It is a simple message with enormous implications. The result in 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab is something that is not quite either traditional 
              academia or industry, but that draws on the best of both. This model 
              is not universally applicable; some problems simply take lots of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> and money to solve. But it sure is fun, and it lets us pursue 
              ideas without trying to distinguish between <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and representation, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and application. Surprisingly 
              often, working this way lets all sides get exactly what they want 
              while doing just what they wish.</p>
<p>The inconvenient <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that we live with reflects the inconvenient 
              institutional divisions that we live with. To get rid of the former, 
              we need to eliminate the latter.</p>
