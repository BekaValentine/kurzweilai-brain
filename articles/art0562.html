              Cyclic Universe</a> by Paul Steinhardt</i></p>
<p>Paul Steinhardt did a very good job of presenting the case for 
              the cyclic <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. I'm going to describe the conventional consensus 
              model upon which he was trying to say that the cyclic model is an 
              improvement. I agree with what Paul said at the end of his talk 
              about comparing these two models; it is yet to be seen which one 
              works. But there are two grounds for comparing them. One is that 
              in both cases the theory needs to be better developed. This is more 
              true for the cyclic model, where one has the issue of what happens 
              when branes collide. The cyclic theory could die when that problem 
              finally gets solved definitively. Secondly, there is, of course, 
              the observational comparison of the gravitational <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">wave</a> predictions 
              of the two models.<br>
<br>
              A brane is short for membrane, a term that comes out of string theories. 
              String theories began purely as theories of strings, but when people 
              began to study their <a class="thought" href="entries/dynamics_entry.html">dynamics</a> more carefully, they discovered that 
              for consistency it was not possible to have a theory which only 
              discussed strings. Whereas a string is a one-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>, 
              the theory also had to include the possibility of membranes of various 
              dimensions to make it consistent, which led to the notion of branes 
              in general. The theory that Paul described in particular involves 
              a four-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> plus one <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> dimension, which he called 
              the bulk. That four-dimensional <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> was sandwiched between two 
              branes.<br>
<br>
              That's not what I'm going to talk about. I want to talk about the 
              conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary picture, and in particular the great boost 
              that this picture has attained over the past few years by the somewhat 
              shocking revelation of a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> that exists in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. 
              This <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, for lack of a better name, is typically called "dark 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>."</p>
<p> But let me start the story further back. <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">Inflation</a>ary theory itself 
              is a twist on the conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/big_bang_entry.html">Big Bang theory</a>. The shortcoming 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> is intended to overcome is the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> fact that, although 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/big_bang_entry.html">Big Bang theory</a> is called the Big Bang, it is in fact not really 
              a theory of a bang at all; it never was. The conventional Big Bang 
              theory, without <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>, was really only a theory of the <i>aftermath</i> 
              of the Bang. It started with all of the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> already 
              in place, already undergoing rapid expansion, already incredibly 
              hot. There was no explanation of how it got that way. </p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">Inflation</a> is an attempt to answer that question, to say what "banged," 
              and what drove the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> into this period of enormous expansion. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">Inflation</a> does that very wonderfully. It explains not only what 
              caused the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> to expand, but also the origin of essentially 
              all the <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> in the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. I qualify that 
              with the word "essentially" because in a typical version 
              of the theory, <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> needs about a gram's worth of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> to 
              start. So, <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> is not quite a theory of the ultimate beginning, 
              but it is a theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> that explains essentially everything 
              that we see around us, starting from almost nothing.</p>
<p> The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> idea behind <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> is that a repulsive form of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> 
              caused the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> to expand. General <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> from its inception 
              predicted the possibility of repulsive <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>; in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of 
              general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> you basically need a material with a negative 
              pressure to create repulsive <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>. According to general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> 
              it's not just <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> densities or <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> densities that create gravitational 
              fields; it's also pressures. A positive pressure creates a normal 
              attractive gravitational field of the kind that we're accustomed 
              to, but a negative pressure would create a repulsive kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a>. 
            </p>
<p>It also turns out that according to modern <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> theories, materials 
              with a negative pressure are easy to construct out of fields which 
              exist according to these theories. By putting together these two 
              ideas&#8212;the fact that <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> gives us states with negative 
              pressures, and that general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a> tells us that those states 
              cause a gravitational repulsion&#8212;we reach the origin of the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary theory.</p>
<p> By answering the question of what drove the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> into expansion, 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary theory can also answer some questions about that 
              expansion that would otherwise be very mysterious. There are two 
              very <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant properties of our observed <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that were never 
              really explained by the <a class="thought" href="entries/big_bang_entry.html">Big Bang theory</a>; they were just part of 
              one's assumptions about the initial conditions. One of them is the 
              uniformity of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>&#8212;the fact that it looks the same 
              everywhere, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> which way you look, as long as you average 
              over large enough volumes. It's both isotropic, meaning the same 
              in all directions, and homogeneous, meaning the same in all places. 
            </p>
<p>The conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/big_bang_entry.html">Big Bang theory</a> never really had an explanation 
              for that; it just had to be assumed from the start. The problem 
              is that, although we know that any <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s will approach 
              a uniform temperature if they are allowed to sit for a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, 
              the early <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> evolved so quickly that there was not enough 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for this to happen. To explain, for example, how the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              could have smoothed itself out to achieve the uniformity of temperature 
              that we observe today in the cosmic background radiation, one finds 
              that in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the standard <a class="thought" href="entries/big_bang_entry.html">Big Bang theory</a>, it would be 
              necessary for <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to be transmitted across the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> at about a hundred times the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>.</p>
<p> In the <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary theory, this problem goes away completely, 
              because in contrast to the conventional theory it postulates a period 
              of accelerated expansion while this repulsive <a class="thought" href="entries/gravity_entry.html">gravity</a> is taking 
              place. That means that if we follow our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> backwards in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              towards the beginning using <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary theory, we see that it 
              started from something much smaller than you ever could have imagined 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a> without <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>. While 
              the region that would evolve to become our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> was incredibly 
              small, there was plenty of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> for it to reach a uniform temperature, 
              just like a cup of coffee sitting on the table cools down to room 
              temperature. Once this uniformity is established on this tiny scale 
              by normal thermal-equilibrium processes&amp;#8212and I'm talking now 
              about something that's about a billion times smaller than the size 
              of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/proton_entry.html">proton</a>&#8212;inflation can take over, and cause this 
              tiny region to expand rapidly, and to become large enough to encompass 
              the entire visible <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. The <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary theory not only allows 
              the possibility for the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> to be uniform, but also tells us 
              why it's uniform: It's uniform because it came from something that 
              had <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to become uniform, and was then stretched by the process 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>.</p>
<p> The second peculiar feature of our <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> that <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a> does 
              a wonderful job of explaining, and for which there never was a prior 
              explanation, is the flatness of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>&#8212;the fact that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> is so close to Euclidean. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, Euclidean <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is not the norm; it's an oddity. 
              With general <a class="thought" href="entries/relativity_entry.html">relativity</a>, curved <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> is the generic case. In the 
              case of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> as a whole, once we assume that the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              is homogeneous and isotropic, then this issue of flatness becomes 
              directly related to the relationship between the mass density and 
              the expansion rate of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>. A large mass density would cause 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> to curve into a closed <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> in the shape of a ball; if 
              the mass density dominated, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> would be a closed <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> 
              with a finite volume and no edge. If a spaceship traveled in what 
              it <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> was a straight line for a long enough distance, it would 
              end up back where it started from. </p>
<p>In the alternative case, if the expansion dominated, the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a> 
              would be geometrically open. Geometrically open spaces have the 
              opposite geometric properties from closed spaces. They're infinite. 
              In a closed <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> two lines which are parallel will start to converge; 
              in an open <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> two lines which are parallel will start to diverge. 
              In either case, what you see is very different from Euclidean <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a>. 
              However, if the mass density is right at the borderline of these 
              two cases, then the <a class="thought" href="entries/geometry_entry.html">geometry</a> is Euclidean, just like we all learned 
              about in high school.</p>
<p> There are two primary predictions that come out of <a class="thought" href="entries/inflation_entry.html">inflation</a>ary 
              models that appear to be testable today. They have to do (1) with 
              the mass density of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and (2) with the properties of 
              the density non-uniformities. I'd like to say a few words about 
              each of them, one at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Let me begin with the question of flatness.</p>
