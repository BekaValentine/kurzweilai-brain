<br><p>Originally published March 19, 2001 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050226183852/http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1014-201-5182352-0.html?tag=rltdnws" target="_new">CNET.com</a>. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 31, 2001.</p>
<p>When it comes to imagining the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, Ray Kurzweil has an impressive list of credentials to state his case. Among other achievements, Kurzweil, who has worked on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> technologies for over four decades, invented the first <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> for the blind.</p>
<p>In his latest venture, the tech <a class="thought" href="entries/entrepreneur_entry.html">entrepreneur</a> has essentially taken on a Johnny Appleseed role, demonstrating how breakthrough--even sci-fi sounding--technologies are going to improve the way people work.</p>
<p>In books and speeches, Kurzweil has sketched out a scenario where the distinction between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> blurs, an emerging era where microscopic "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s" will be able to trigger images allowing people to operate in <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> whenever the mood or need strikes.</p>
<p>But Kurzweil's musings have also triggered a larger debate about what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> in a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> marked by a fusion with robotic technologies and synthetic personalities. Most notably, he has been paired as the sunny optimist vs. <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>, the chief scientist at <a class="thought" href="entries/sun_microsystems_entry.html">Sun Microsystems</a>, who last year penned a long article that raised a red flag about some of Kurzweil's ideas.</p>
<p>The inventor-author nonetheless is optimistic about the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> and last month gave a public demonstration of how a singer could be transformed into a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> persona in real <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Kurzweil talked about his ideas in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Where do you go in terms of bringing the concept of conversational Web site <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s into more regular, everyday use?</p>
<p>&#160;We're investigating options for Web-based speech recognition. This will take <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, but eventually you will be able to speak to her and get good quality back. It'll probably take six to 12 months. We are doing constant work on updating her <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_base_entry.html">knowledge base</a>, but she also has a lot of general <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> from conversation. Of course, she doesn't yet pass the <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a>. (The <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_test_entry.html">Turing test</a> was developed by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> to determine whether <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can "think.")</p>
<p>Take the 30,000-foot view. What do you envision as the predominant benefit society will derive from <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a>?</p>
<p>&#160;There are several ways to approach this. I think <a class="thought" href="entries/avatar_entry.html">avatar</a>s will be a near-term trend over the next several years. We'll see them as a very useful <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a>. They're entertaining but also a good way to interact with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s.</p>
