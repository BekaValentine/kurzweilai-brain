Not because speech recognition won't work, but because it'll be a problem in an office environment.  Of course, if we somehow transition to everyone working at home - say via availability of ultra-broadband combined with an energy crisis - it could happen.  Still, I suspect that 5 years is a bit too short a time for such a massive change-over to occur.  Maybe if the energy crisis hits by 2009, by 2015 we'll have shifted to work-at-home, and speech to text will have caught on.

Me, I like my keyboard - gives my text-creation process a degree of privacy.  I may wait for the direct brain-to-display interface, before I give up on keyboards...

ScienCentral, Nov. 19, 2004
<br>
NASA engineers are developing technology that picks up and translates throat signals into words before they're even spoken, using subvocal speech. 
<br>
<br>
Electrodes picks up electromyographic signals near the chin and larnyx, which are amplified and processed with neural network software to decipher word patterns. 
<br>
<br>
Applications could include speech ailments, covert communication in military operations, private speech between individuals, situations where you can't speak normally (underwater or in fire gear or where there's high noise or you have a respirator ... or the killer app: a silent cell phone.

On the point of voice technology, I remember reading somewhere that brain scanning technologies are now at the stage where they can tell what you're thinking about from the patterns displayed, so maybe given enough time and progress we will merely think and the computer will understand our thoughts, so i wouldn't have to physically type these words, just say them in my mind.</p></td>

If one assumes that, they will last until then, just imagine how miserable every human will be. Emotions which are vital for human survival will no longer exist. The author of the Timeline should have included a subtitle starting with a big &#8220;IF&#8221;. I am so happy to be 57 years old so I will not see these predictions come true if they ever do.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> It's intersting that this thread is titled age of Spiritual machines, and then shows a strong bias in the timeline toward  mechanical processes.
<br>
<br>
 First, it seems the definition of "spiritual" is in order, and how a machine corresponds to the mechanical process listed in the timeline.
<br>
<br>
 Western assumptions about "spirituality" is simply a parallel to mechanical concepts. That is, conversion of more and more units of energy into a singular process of organization.
<br>
<br>
 While Aristltole compared thinking to the processes of a machine, his own thuinking was shaped by alphabetic text that provided a linear process of thought based on interchangeability of words and ideas.
<br>
<br>
 But mechanical process of social organization may have begun in war, since a machine-like response in the face of danger had no value until men began to make war on each other.
<br>
<br>
 Minsky points out that our genes had little choice but to develop organization using competition, which expanded as a social strategy into an algorithm that drove us toward war.
<br>
<br>
 The most successful cultures were the most war-like and the most machine-like. Christianity and Islam rose to power via the sword and not due to virtues of humility taught by the founders.
<br>
<br>
 The gene pool has a way of hijacking social goals and subordinating them to competitive forces. Consequently, the rise of the machine is but an extension of a genetic strategy to perpetuate the most successful gene and meme at the expense of weaker genes.
<br>
<br>
 The rise of technology has another factor which seems ignored in the timeline: an increase of tenchology creates uncertainty, so that social systems will speciate into cults and sub-cults to minimize uncertainty.
<br>
<br>
 Freedom created by technology creates an excessive decision load on the people, who quickly form ideological communities that screen the "noise" provided by technology.
<br>
<br>
 The attempt to unite under a powerful truth tends to produce a diversity of sub-groups(sub-routines) having the same basic "DNA" of the parent group, but sopeciating into more specialized groups to minimize decision loads.
<br>
<br>
 I suibmit that "spirituality" is that process of speciation to create greater diversity resulting from our machine-like attempts to create unity of thought. The more we create uniformity, the more we must recognize difference at more complex levels.
<br>
<br>
 As Minsky might say, there is a "higher" level that is concealing its true purpose of diversity and differentiation while letting us seek unity and organization of concepts, only that higher level is claoked and not accessible to our single brains.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Welcome to 2009! Let's take the 2009 predictions and see where we stand. I mean, if RK can't predict 10 years ahead, what use is it to even try predicting anything beyond that?
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: A $1,000 personal computer can perform about a trillion calculations per second.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: True if you include a high-end graphics card like ATI Radeon HD 4870 or NVIDIA GTX 280, both being about a teraflop. However, the fastest CPU is Intel Core i7 965 and is only about 70 gigaflops.
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Personal computers with high-resolution visual displays come in a range of sizes, from those small enough to be embedded in clothing and jewelry up to the size of a thin book.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: Partially true - we're not embedding much into clothing or jewelry. But we do have iphones and netbooks and such.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Cables are disappearing. Communication between components uses short-distance wireless technology. High-speed wireless communication provides access to the Web.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: True. However, cables are not really going away anytime soon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition. Also ubiquitous are language user interfaces (LUIs).
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: False. Vast majority still use keyboards and mice, and touchscreens are popular with smartphones.
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Most routine business transactions (purchases, travel, reservations) take place between a human and a virtual personality.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: Partially true. Self check-out lines in supermarkets with voice-overs exist, although I would not call them a "personality". Purchases can be done online - again, no virtual personality, although no human salesperson either.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Often, the virtual personality includes an animated visual presence that looks like a human face.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: lol False. Reminds me of the talking-face hologram in the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Interesting idea but its not anywhere in sight.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Although traditional classroom organization is still common, intelligent courseware has emerged as a common means of learning.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: Partially true. I'm not sure on-line colleges count as "intelligent courseware" but they are also not a traditional classroom either, just not intelligent at all.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Pocket-sized reading machines for the blind and visually impaired, "listening machines" (speech-to-text conversion) for the deaf, and computer- controlled orthotic devices for paraplegic individuals result in a growing perception that primary disabilities do not necessarily impart handicaps.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: Partially true. We have reading machines for blind, I don't know how popular they are. I haven't heard of listening machines but they're probably not very popular either. We have some experimentatal devices for paraplegic people but nothing on market that I know of. But definitely there is no growing perception that primary disabilities do not impart handicaps - not this year anyway.
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Translating telephones (speech-to-speech language translation) are commonly used for many language pairs.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: False. Never heard of these yet.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Accelerating returns from the advance of computer technology have resulted in continued economic expansion. Price deflation, which had been a reality in the computer field during the twentieth century, is now occurring outside the computer field. The reason for this is that virtually all economic sectors are deeply affected by the accelerating improvement in the price performance of computing.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: False. The US and global economy is in the trash right now. Most products are going through inflation like they always did. Very few things are advancing fast and becoming cheaper like computers traditionally did. Maybe cell phones or something, but really the impact isn't the same as what this prediction is stating.
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Human musicians routinely jam with cybernetic musicians.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: False. Guitar Hero doesn't count as cybernetic musicians either, and those who play it don't count as musicians. I think I saw an experimental japanese robot play an instrument recently, but that's as close as we are to that.
<br>
<br>
<br>
PREDICTION: Bioengineered treatments for cancer and heart disease have greatly reduced the mortality from these diseases.
<br>
<br>
VERDICT: False. There was improvement of maybe a few percent but that's about it, mortality rates are largely unchanged for those things.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This just shows that no matter who you are and no matter how intensely you study technological progress, you can't predict the future, not even a few years ahead. Nobody knows the future, period. And the further out you go, the more silly and ridiculous your predictions will look. Some of them will be way overblown, others will be way too conservative, and others will just be flat out laughable because things just went in an entirely different, completely unpredictable direction.
<br>
<br>
But as someone wise once said when referring to the nature of the purpose of all existence - "all there is is lessons". We're all here to learn how narrow-minded and presumptuous and ignorant we truly are, and then maybe try to be a little less ignorant once we realize it.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Interesting conclusions. You obviously attempted to be fair, but I feel a number of your points and assessments may be challenged by others on the forum who keep up with Ray Kurzweils work. Those who have studied both "The Age of Spiritual Machines" and "The Singularity Is Near" and continually follow his lectures and conferences at which he speaks. 
<br>
<br>
He has always had his jealous puffed-up detractors who are big on theory and small on action - I doubt the paper shufflers will ever disappear (and It is unlikely he would even want this). Reading comments that his critics wrote (think John Searle) in 1999 are comical today. 
<br>
<br>
IMO a number of "predictions" you marked as
<br>
partially true or false are instead true or close enough to be called true. For me the key is to look at the big picture, not the details which are bound to vary.
<br>
<br>
All and all, Ray's predictions are based on deep "understanding" of technology, not blind faith (example: music and reading Machines.)
<br>
<br>
 I do not have time to elaborate right now, but hopefully someone else will. I find Ray Kurzweil's work accurate, logical and correct overall. 
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your thought provoking post. ; ) H.</p></td>
