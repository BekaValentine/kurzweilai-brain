<div class="TeaserText">In the coming years, the world could experience a series of massively transformative events, or "wild cards," brought on by radical developments in areas such as AI and nanotechnology. Futurist John Petersen suggests strategies for dealing with them proactively.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Adapted from the book <i>Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a> Surprises</i>, published January 2000. Published on KurzweilAI.net March 7, 2001.</p>
<blockquote>"We are not made wise by recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>."--George Bernard Shaw</blockquote>
<p>Wild Cards are low-probability, extremely high-impact events that are social and technological developments or natural phenomena sharing four characteristics. Wild Cards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>global in scope and directly effect the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> condition;</li>
<li>potentially disruptive (negatively and/or positively);</li>
<li>intrinsically beyond the control of any single institution, group or individual; and</li>
<li>rapidly moving.</li>
</ul>
<p>The unprecedented change occurring in almost every sector of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> presents the significant likelihood that in the nearing years, the world could experience a series of massively transformative events--some of which will seemingly come out of the blue. At The Arlington Institute, we call such titanic-size surprises Wild Cards.</p>
<p>Conventional <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> would say that Wild Cards are nearly impossible to anticipate. There are small surprises, both positive and negative that spring up in our daily lives--accidents, good fortune and personal revelations. And while those events can have tremendous personal significance, they don't ripple out to the national or global stage. And then there are trends: continuously building patterns that wind their way through society, the environment and the economy. The <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of trends makes them relatively easier to monitor and predict.</p>
<p>To someone who is trying to make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of what might be on the horizon, the broad sweeping surprises, Wild Cards, could have the most meaning.</p>
<p>Different people define big surprises in different ways, but we suggest that Wild Cards are low-probability, high-impact events that happen very quickly. Like a major hurricane devastating a town in a single day, the chance of these Wild Cards happening is very small indeed. However, if they do show up, they have huge, monumental consequences.</p>
<p>There are other large scale events--like world wars--that clearly have had global effects, but they are not entirely unanticipated--at least not by the aggressor. Wild Cards generally surprise everyone, in part because they materialize so quickly; so quickly that the underlying social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s cannot effectively respond to them.</p>
<p>Wild Cards strike fast, they aren't what are usually called "unintended consequences." Large numbers of women moving into the workforce in the 1950s was a major, unexpected surprise that had great impact on families and economies. But it came gradually enough for the social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s to reconfigure to the changes. Wild Cards, on the other hand, force the limits of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> capabilities abruptly. Because they approach so quickly and reach so far, there is not a predetermined mechanism in place to effectively deal with the ensuing changes.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s do not easily cope with rapid change. Dictatorships, theoretically the most efficient form of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>, produce economies and social structures that, in this day and age, do not have the technological and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al underpinnings to move briskly and intelligently. Alternatively, democratic forms of <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> can be unruly and unwieldy institutions. Swift solutions get caught in the mire of bureaucracy and the customary <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for consensus.</p>
<p>There is a general assumption that surprises are, well, surprises, and that there is nothing we can do about them. Perhaps that has been the case in the past, but we are entering an era where the scale of potentially transformative events is greater than ever--and therefore, they demand greater attention.</p><h1><b>All That Came Before</b></h1><p>The historical implications of past trends and Wild Cards have produced a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that responds relatively well when events come at predictable rates. Trends and crosscutting effects have always been with us--we have generally learned how to adapt to them. We have a problem, though, when big surprises start to roll in.</p>
<p>In the past century there haven't been many Wild Cards. The crash of the stock market in 1929 followed by the Great Depression was probably the last unanticipated, fast-moving <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that rocked the world in a significant way. If the threat of a nuclear war had been realized, then that certainly would have qualified as a Wild Card <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>. Our current <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary environmental crisis could easily produce a variety of Wild Cards, but right now most people perceive it as gradual and regular in its development. We are now exiting the 500-year-long age of enlightenment and industry, transiting into the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> era and accelerating toward a new world on the horizon that promises to be quite different from even the recent past.</p>
<p>We can get a <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of what is happening at the present <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> by examining how our actual understanding of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> has developed and <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed to this point. As each succeeding age of development has evolved, a regular relationship has emerged: each new era is about one-tenth of the length of its predecessor. Starting with single-celled <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, moving to multiple-celled organisms and step-by-step through <a class="thought" href="entries/mammal_entry.html">mammal</a>s, early man, and finally the age of enlightenment and industry, it seems as if <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is accelerating. In fact, it is only the amount of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> that is exploding, lifting each succeeding period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to a new, much more complex version of reality in shorter amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.</p>
<p>It is very valuable indeed to understand the dynamics of this change. There are long periods defined by one fundamental level of development (vertebrates, early man, etc.) that are rather suddenly displaced by the insertion of a radically new level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, which in turn becomes the basis for the new era. In <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s this is called punctuated equilibrium: periods of relative equilibrium punctuated by major changes to a higher level of development. The length of these periods of equilibrium are getting shorter and shorter while the jumps to new levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> are growing higher at an exponential rate.</p>
<p>The transition from one era to another is, in relative <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> terms, abrupt and discontinuous. Something new happens that is so different from the past that it redefines reality in a period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that in historical terms is quite brief. During one of the last major transitions, humanity moved from the Middle Ages, to the <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">Renaissance</a>, to the age of Enlightenment, and into the Industrial Age over an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary period of about 300, made possible mostly by a simple, elegant <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>: the printing press.</p>
<p>The saturation of the world by broadcast <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s happened much faster, and of course <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> have spread across the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> in less than two decades--the blink of an eye in the grand scheme of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>We are now living in another period of significant transition--a foreshortened span of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, during which our surroundings and experiences will change more than during any era in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>. Humanity has never lived through the convergence--and, in some cases, the collision--of global forces of such magnitude and <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a>. Because they are so great and move so fast we have extraordinary difficulty with <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically considering what might happen and what the implications could be. One foreseeable outcome might be global instability; another, a <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/renaissance_entry.html">renaissance</a>. In any case, during the next two decades, almost every aspect of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> will be fundamentally reshaped.</p><h1><b>Wild Cards worth considering...</b></h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">Energy</a> Revolution: clean, cheap and unlimited <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> for the world A breakthrough in leading-edge <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> spawns the rapid emergence of new technologies that provide inexhaustible, inexpensive and non-polluting sources of <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>.</p>

How do they behave? If we can begin to describe the characteristics of Wild Cards we are on our way to understanding how we might be able to effectively deal with them. Big surprises have a number of common <a class="thought" href="entries/attribute_entry.html">attribute</a>s.</p>
<p>Wild Cards are complicated. <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">System</a>s dynamics and the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> are the best tools we have for understanding the behavior of "complex adaptive <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s," the term used to describe things like economies, ecosystems, societies, or even teenagers. All of us are complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s of many interconnected nodes that behave in nonlinear ways. That is to say, after a certain level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> is reached, a rain forest, the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, or a weather <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> does not exhibit linear, logical, predictable behavior. The unpredictable interaction between and among all of the parts and <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s in the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> guarantees that a small, seemingly insignificant occurrence in one place can start a chain reaction that results in huge shifts for the entire <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, as illustrated in the now famous theory of the "Butterfly Effect." A butterfly in Brazil flaps its wings, and starts a chain reaction of millions of gradually growing weather events that ultimately results in a Caribbean hurricane.</p>
<p>Wild Cards are punctuations in the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. They disrupt the equilibrium. They cause major, rapid change. And sometimes, they are the result of a series of events that, in and of themselves have not produced any noticeable change--but suddenly, boom! A Wild Card emerges out of the blue.</p>
<p>Complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s adapt in sometimes surprising new ways to their <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. As the environment changes, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> adjusts to most effectively react to the new situation, often suddenly shifting to a new <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> exhibiting a behavior called punctuated equilibrium. Essentially, the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> assimilates <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> or other inputs over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, not making any gross changes (equilibrium), until rather suddenly it rapidly (punctuated) reconfigures to a new shape, form, or function. If you drop grains of sand one-by-one onto a pile, the overall shape will slowly change, but the change will be <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary. Suddenly, the addition of a single grain will cause the previously stable pyramid of sand to break and collapse, taking an entirely new shape.</p>
<p>This "predictable unpredictability" can be seen in every major era of <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. It maintained its general <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> for a given period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and then rapidly shifted to a new epoch centered on a new defining characteristic. Complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s behave like this: social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, weather <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, political <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, and the global economy. The advent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> is a great example of punctuated equilibrium: out of the blue came a new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that in five short years revolutionizes global <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and the fundamental structure of the world's economic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>.</p>
<p>Wild Cards can originate anywhere. In terms of their initiation, Wild Cards are neutral. They can be "acts of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>" or <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> produced--or combinations of both.</p>
<p>Wild Cards can be driven by perception. At The Arlington Institute, our central interest is with <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> behavior, and this is where perception comes on par with reality. Particularly with social events, the big surprise can be precipitated by how people perceive the problem, not what actually comes from the problem. The discovery of an "Ebola-like" disease could be bad for Africa (or wherever it started), but the rapidly spreading news of a <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> could have a more dramatic effect on people's perceptions than from the actual threat of exposure to the disease.</p>
<p>Wild Cards can be both positive and negative. Although it may seem that most Wild Cards are negative, there are many that could be positive, such as an <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> revolution that produces non-polluting electricity. If <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering continues, there will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> within the next two decades when most major diseases, like <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, could be curable--a very positive effect. Some Wild Cards contain both positive and negative potentiality. For instance, the collapse of the sperm count could be absolutely positive, in that it decreases population <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a>, thereby relieving <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> pressure on natural resources. However, the effects would be clearly negative if a specific portion of the population or race experiences a dramatic drop in fertility.</p>
<p>One Wild Card can <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> off more Wild Cards. Because there are so many <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s within the huge <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that makes up <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> activity, one big <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> can spark a chain of events that exponentially magnifies the impact of the initial Wild Card. An <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that might be manageable in isolation can, in concert with other factors, create a cascading effect that is chaotic, unpredictable, and intrinsically out of control. The first <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> makes the second one more likely, and the snowball starts rolling. For example, a major environmental disaster could seed a global epidemic that results in quarantines of nations, leading to greatly reduced air travel, which in turn causes the collapse of the global airline industry. Each <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> builds on the other, creating unmanageable implications.</p>
<p>Unrelated Wild Cards can have synergistic effects. Timing is everything. Two or more unrelated Wild Cards might show up in close <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> proximity and even though one did not directly effect or precipitate the other, their net effect will be much greater than if they happened in isolation. Since by definition Wild Cards shake the underlying social <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, if the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> has been upset by one big <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, a second one would have a larger than usual impact because the social institutions are already greatly taxed. A great earthquake on the West Coast of the United States, followed closely by the explosion of a terrorist nuclear <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> in the U.S. would produce a heightened <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a>, as the nation fought fires on two fronts with a support <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> already damaged by the initial earthquake.</p>
<p>We are inventing the possibility of new Wild Cards. One thing that makes this era unique is the global <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> that is rapidly being put in place--and this <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has only just begun. As many as seven <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> satellite "constellations," each with hundreds of individual satellites, will be circling the <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">earth</a> soon after the turn of the century. This will make it possible to send and receive any kind of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> from any location on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> to any other. The result will be something very much like a <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>ary nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. It will make no difference whether you are in the Sahara Desert or the heart of Wall Street; with a small, inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>, you'll be in touch.</p>
<p>The increasing level of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>--and dependency--introduces new kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-oriented big surprises that did not exist before such as the failure of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> from a particularly virulent "worm" <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> or a deliberate attempt by an individual or group to destroy the workings of this global nervous <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The possibilities of this <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> revolution are not just negative but could also spell the ultimate end to institutions like authoritarian <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s, as they lose the ability to control the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that is received by their citizens. Global <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> delivery <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will act as powerful enablers, carrying big ideas everywhere--thus making any globally significant <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> that much more acute.</p>
<p>Some Wild Cards are "too big to let happen." The exponentially growing scientific and economic development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race is producing a new class of Wild Cards that threaten the very ability of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> to support advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>. In the past, big <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> surprises did little more than cause regional social or physical disruptions. Saddam Hussein's torching of the Kuwaiti oil wells, or the defoliating of the Vietnamese jungles despoiled vast geographic areas but did not threaten the entire world. Great plagues of the past were limited to Europe or other areas, never reaching throughout the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.</p>
<p>But now, with the advent of nuclear weapons, global industrial development that has geometrically increased environmental pollution, an unprecedented population explosion, and potential scientific discoveries that could result in the manipulation of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> itself, the implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> activity have taken on a new, potentially ominous scale. There are also externally initiated events, such as a comet or asteroid strike that have dire global implications</p>
<p>We believe that there are ways to get in front of some of these big changes and position ourselves to be proactive, rather than reactive. So again, we arrive at this unique historical period of <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> where <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about big surprises in creative new ways becomes an imperative, not just an interesting, sideline.</p>
<p>Dealing with Wild Cards</p>
<blockquote>"An ounce of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> is worth a ton of theory."--Friedrich Engels</blockquote>
<p>Something can indeed be done about Wild Cards, if we look at them as discontinuities that require unconventional <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> and analysis processes. Discontinuities have been problematic from a mathematical point of view. The legendary mathematicians, Sir <a class="thought" href="entries/newton_entry.html">Isaac Newton</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/leibniz_entry.html">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, between them invented the brilliant mathematical tool we call <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a>, which allows us to track things that gradually wax and wane, increase and decrease, without any sudden jumps and breaks.</p>
<p>This teaches us a great deal about "functions" that are continuous. But it leaves us at a loss to understand sudden breaks and discontinuities. It's as though we can understand and do a <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>able job of predicting the ways the Stock Market will work--assuming there isn't a "Black Tuesday" crash like the one in 1929 that ushered in the Great Depression. But the crash itself?--discontinuous and therefore impossible to predict.</p>
<p>Until, that is, the French mathematician Rene Thom devised a new form of <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> that he called "Catastrophe Theory"--a <a class="thought" href="entries/calculus_entry.html">calculus</a> of discontinuities--described in his 1975 book, Structural Stability and Morphogenesis. Thom's work involves the visualization or <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> simulation of some very complex higher-dimensional shapes, including such things as "periodic folds," "pinching bifurcations," and "saddle connection catastrophes." It allows us to begin to understand the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of sudden change with the same mathematical rigor that we presently employ to understand gradual change.</p>
<p>Discontinuities and surprises, then, like <a class="thought" href="entries/chaos_entry.html">chaos</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>, have an internal <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to them. Nonlinear and "out of the box" <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> training, <a class="thought" href="entries/intuition_entry.html">intuition</a>, associative <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, even dreamwork--these are all techniques for shaking up old assumptions and allowing new ideas to emerge.</p>
<p>When the best <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is available, a new understanding of the potential problem is much more likely to suggest a new direction of <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. This in turn will help defuse the Wild Card before it erupts--or it will give one a head start on adjusting to the big changes that a Wild Card may bring. There are occurrences and realities that our societies now handle routinely that, just a few years ago, would have been unmanageable surprises.</p>
<p>We can learn a great deal from <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about these events. We figure out how they work, and we put in place the necessary means to ameliorate them. But it is important to understand that most of these answers and indicators will not be found in the usual places.</p>
<p>A <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atic, open-minded approach to Wild Cards will revolve around at least three <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> rules. The first and most fundamental rule is:</p>
<p>RULE I: If you don't think about Wild Cards before they happen, all of the value in <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> about them is lost. If one accepts that there will be an increasing number of Wild Cards in the near <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, then the only effective defense is to begin to <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>atically think about them now. The more that is known about a potential <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, the less threatening it becomes because the solutions become obvious.</p>
<p>In every case, no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> the potential Wild Card:</p>
<p>RULE II: <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a>ing and understanding <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> is key.Whether identifying early warning signs of a Wild Card, understanding its structure, or developing a response, a sophisticated, effective <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> gathering and analysis process is needed. This process requires input from experts in <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s behavior, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_theory_entry.html">complexity theory</a> and other "new <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>s," as well as from many traditional disciplines. <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">Access</a> to a robust <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of resources is a must. Constant outreach through conferences, conventions, and other professional meetings provide links to other individuals and ideas that would otherwise escape one's field of view.</p>
<p>Because we are moving into a new period where potential events outstrip our existing capabilities for understanding and dealing with them, it is also true that:</p>
<p>RULE III. Extraordinary events require extraordinary approaches. Some of these potential events look so big, strange, and scary because our typical methods of problem solving are incongruent with events of this magnitude and character. If we are to deal with them effectively before they occur, we will need a new mindset. We have to look at potential problems in a different <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>. Often, the most commonly used tools--political, economic, and <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> influence, to name a few--will not be equal to the task.</p>
<p>This era of global transition will result in the redesign of the fundamentals of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> activity. People and organizations that look for ways to deal with unprecedented events will be better prepared to survive and prosper. To be part of that group, you must first unleash yourself from the past and be willing to take risks. You must objectively <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> tools and perspectives.</p>
<p>Many of the solutions we seek will not come from conventional sources. Otherwise, they would already be obvious to us. New answers will come from unexpected places. They will originate from individuals who look at the world in <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> ways and who see solutions where others do not. These people are not usually found in the mainstream.</p>
<p>It will require good judgment to identify the potential jewels in these places. The "fringe" is typically the domain of more than the usual number of charlatans and misguided individuals. But the discoveries are worth the explorations. <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">History</a> has shown that significant breakthroughs, from Copernicus to Einstein, often initially seem strange and somewhat unbelievable.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This article starts with an interesting concept, and takes it . . . not very far. I would like help in imaging what happens when these events occur. For example, if there is limitless free energy in the world, what is the world like? Where, exactly, is the problem? To say that "Gee, the world might change a lot, quickly" doesn't engage the mind. "Catastrophes can happen, and we should try to prevent that." Yes, I knew that.</p></td>
