<div class="TeaserText">Integration of human and machine will lead to an interconnected "organism"--the next major evolutionary step forward for humanity, says immunology PhD candidate Danny Belkin.</div>
<br>
<br><p>Originally published February 26, 2001 on KurzweilAI.net.</p>
<p>The discussion regarding the <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race, recently addressed in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194610/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html" target="_new">Bill Joy's article in Wired</a> has focused mainly on the question of technologies which might endanger that <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. One specific threat which has been discussed is the danger posed to humans from a superior <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. While the discussion itself is an important and relevant one, I would suggest that <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> and other technological developments may yet, should we avoid self-destruction, free us from worry about such threats, and instead present us with a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> quite different from the common "humankind manages not to destroy itself and sets out to colonise the <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a>" scenario.</p>
<p>The drive for scientific and technological development during the last century, while indeed creating great dangers to our very existence, has brought us to the brink of a major change not only in the way we live, but in who we are--both individually and as a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>. In this broad field of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are unique in that they facilitate the advances in <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and push us toward the immense leap that we, as a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, are <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to make.</p>
<p>A similar, if slightly less complex situation occurred on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> a long <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> ago.</p><h1>Multicellularity</h1><p>Many millions of years ago, the first living cells evolved. These ancient unicellular organisms, swimming about in the primordial soup, had a sole function--survival in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to reproduce. Their chances of survival could be jeopardised by the conditions in which they lived, parasites, or other cells competing with them for the same <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> source.</p>
<p>Over millions of years, the evolving cells acquired increasingly sophisticated ways to cope with these threats. They developed <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanisms that could counter the damaging effect of their surroundings, offensive mechanisms and defensive counter-measures to cope with the competing organisms and, ultimately, co-operation between cells of the same <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>.</p>
<p>Offensive mechanisms could be used by these cells in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to achieve superiority over competing organisms, allowing the triumphant cells to reproduce and proliferate. These mechanisms are believed to have been the precursors for the much more complex <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that control <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> in higher organisms. <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> processes, tweaked and refined during <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>, entered a new stage upon the emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/eukaryote_entry.html">Eukaryote</a>s. These more highly evolved cells contained cellular bodies and compartments, in which more complex <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> processes occur.</p>
<p>Over the eons during which these cells evolved, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> and co-operation between individual cells emerged as key factors in the struggle for survival under adverse conditions. Over millions of years, this co-operation increased to the point at which the cells combined to become multicellular organisms.</p><h1>An <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a>ary Leap</h1><p>The emergence of multicellular organisms can be viewed as a highly significant leap forward in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process<i>.</i> It was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> individual organisms had established a permanent connection with one another in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to collectively enhance their chances of survival<i>.</i> These primitive multicellular organisms developed complex intra- and inter-cellular signaling <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, some of which were aimed at regulating <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a>. These increased their chances of survival by getting rid of the cells least likely to cope with the environment and thus minimising <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> expenditure by the organism. Dead cells could also be used to shield the multicellular organisms from the environment. Some of these mechanisms, such as the protective dead outer layers of the skin, are still evident in humans.</p>
<p>Thus, <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> (PCD), generally defined as a <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> mechanism for the removal of superfluous, infected, or damaged cells by activation of an intrinsic suicide <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, gives a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> population the "ability" to select its fittest cells. It also allows a <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> population to adapt its numbers to a changing environment.</p>
<p>These terms "selection", "adapt", " fit" are familiar to us from the theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. However, PCD and the theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> may have more in common than mere terminology. PCD is a mechanism that is used extensively during an organism's development, mainly for optimising connections between cells and killing potentially harmful or redundant cells. Thus, it allows the killing of those cells that have grown incorrectly and/or have been damaged. In other words, harmless cells that have developed in the appropriate circumstances (in which the <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>'s microenvironment and neighboring cells supply the suitable conditions) will survive. In <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary terms, only the "fit" cells will survive. This "micro-<a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>" during an organism's <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> makes it possible for the individual to achieve the best functional interconnected <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> population, based upon the genetic blueprint for that organism.</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">Program</a>med <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">Cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> in Humans: Altering <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">Evolution</a></h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/homo_sapiens_entry.html">Homo sapiens</a> and other highly evolved <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> have a long <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> span, and as a consequence the rate of their <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is very slow. This is clearly evident in comparison with <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, which mutate rapidly and can therefore cope with adverse conditions that would otherwise wipe out an entire population. A rapid mutation rate can lead to the emergence of an individual whose genetic makeup has changed enough to allow it to grow even in an unfavorable environment. This rapid <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> is the underlying cause of the appearance of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> that are resistant to <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s. The slow pace of genetic mutation and selection in organisms higher on the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary scale promoted the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that would allow these organisms to cope with changes in the environment and attack by other living creatures in another way--not by genetic mutation and selection of the fittest organisms for survival, but by adaptation of the "selection" process into the organism, becoming a process that occurs within the organism during its lifetime.</p>
<p>In humans, this "selective" PCD process, especially during the development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_nervous_system_entry.html">central nervous system</a> (CNS), is one of the factors enabling the <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> process and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. In the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> of unnecessary cells means that only those cells with the best connections to their neighboring cells will survive, thus ensuring the optimal <a class="thought" href="entries/configuration_entry.html">configuration</a> and "wiring" of <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. In illustrating this, <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers used a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_network_entry.html">neural network</a> model to examine the value of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al overproduction and the role of PCD in the development of the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>. They found that <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al overproduction, with the subsequent deletion of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s, allowed significantly greater <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> ability (problem-solving ability) than that accomplished when starting out with only the necessary number of <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. In more developed organisms PCD is an important factor in the creation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s, allowing complex <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> functions.</p>
<p>Another important area in which PCD is utilized in humans is the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>. A vast number of potentially harmful <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s are present in our environment. These micro-organisms possess rapid rates of mutation, which lead to the emergence of strains capable of surviving natural <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> defense mechanisms or modern <a class="thought" href="entries/antibiotic_entry.html">antibiotic</a>s. Humans and other advanced organisms take longer to evolve, as their genetic changes occur during much longer <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> periods, and thus must develop a mechanism to cope with this constant attack. In response to this need, the <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>_in which massive killing of unnecessary and potentially harmful cells occurs during early development--was developed and grew <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ively more complex during <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, the development of both the immune and the <a class="thought" href="entries/central_nervous_system_entry.html">central nervous system</a>s can be viewed as the result of a change in the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary process of selection, from a process that occurs within a population and is influenced by the surrounding environment to an internal developmental process that supplies humans with <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> (through development of a complex <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>) and the ability to fend off attack from <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s (through a defensive <a class="thought" href="entries/immune_system_entry.html">immune system</a>).</p>
<p>Carrying this line of <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> further, it can be argued that the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> has enabled humans to begin "disconnecting" from the classical <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary selection process. Developed countries offer their citizens modern <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>, which means that in most cases people now survive the <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>l and viral infections that would have killed them during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and instead die from heart disease, <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, neurodegenerative diseases, and other aging-related, inherent dysfunctions of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> body, for which cures will probably be found in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the way in which <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> genes are spread has changed. No longer are they transmitted according to the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary maxim of "survival of the fittest." Modern norms and perceptions have a stronger effect on the process of mating than choosing the strongest <a class="thought" href="entries/male_entry.html">male</a> in the tribe. Most individuals marry only once or twice and consequently do not spread their genes widely. The genetically and physically "weak" do not die, and thus weak genetic traits are passed on and do not disappear. It thus seems that the way in which the process of <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> occurs has changed; it is no longer a process involving the selection of the fittest organisms, but has turned into a <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>al developmental one. Occurring in the <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>, it allows us to overcome the mainly physical factors which used to play such an important part in determining which individuals would survive and which wouldn't; and it clearly influences the way genes are spread (geeks are now good prospects!).</p><h1><a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">Network</a>ed Humanity</h1><p><a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> culture and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> advance by means of the pooling of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, whether acquired through meetings, correspondence, or literature. Thus, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> is the method by which <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and technological ability continue to <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. Better means of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> allow the pooling of our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> in more efficient ways, giving rise to a more rapid pace of scientific and technological <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development. This in turn fuels accelerated <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, the result of which we can see today as an explosion in technological advancement.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with PCD and <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>? As proposed earlier, humanity has all but ceased to evolve in the way described by Darwin--by the incorporation and utilization of PCD as an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, allowing <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> (a process which occurred over millions of years). And <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> itself, brought forth and refined by various mechanisms for the selection and connection of the fittest cells, has created the means to facilitate better <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s between <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> beings. The latest step in this process is the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>--which, to use a worn out clich&#233;, "is bringing people closer together."</p>
<p>This advancement in interpersonal <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s is <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to continue, the ultimate stage being the development of a totally integrated <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>, which is likely to be achieved by highly advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>--<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. Preliminary <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> on this subject is already being done, for example in the implantation of artificial <a class="thought" href="entries/retina_entry.html">retina</a>s, connected to the optic <a class="thought" href="entries/nerve_entry.html">nerve</a>, into eyes of blind people. As <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are already interconnected, the merging of humans into a super-high-<a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> will bring about the next level of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>: a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> meta-<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>.</p>
<p>Just as the merging of a large number of individual cells ultimately led to the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, the merging of humans into an interconnected <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> meta-<a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> will eventually create a collective <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> for all the individual participants. The forerunner of this "global" <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> is already evident: our world is already described as a global village. Mass <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>, the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>, and present-day <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s make it possible for people with <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to these services to know instantly what is going on in every part of the globe. <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> is much more immediately <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ible; withholding it from the public much more difficult. As a consequence, public opinion (stemming from the emerging global <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>) has become such an important factor that the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> has become a major fighting ground for <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>s.</p>
<p>The way in which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ing shows that we are already quite far along this road. The simplicity of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> distribution, be it sharing of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a>, ideas, or any other <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>, lies at the heart of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. This sharing is <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> to develop as <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> does, leading ultimately to a state in which <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> flows freely.</p>
<p>Computing power sharing on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> is another area that demonstrates the power of the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, and its importance is likely to increase. SETI@home is a good example of what can be done by pooling the vast amount of unused computing resources available through the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. Up to now, most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s have been used as end-terminals for <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed through the net. The true capabilities and potential of an interconnected <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, even in terms of raw processing power, are mind-boggling. Imagine what a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> of fully interconnected humans, their mental abilities pooled and enhanced, will be like.</p><h1>Questions and <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">Thought</a>s</h1><p>To the majority of observers, the development of modern <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> must seem as a random, uncontrolled process. Metaphorically, we are seen as riding out of control on this mustang called technological development. The individuals who make this happen are motivated by various forces: some are in it for the money, some for the pure fascination of scientific discovery, and some want to make the world a better place. Consider, as an example, the currently booming <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> of IT. The development of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has goals that transcend the immediate aim of, say, enabling people to surf the net using a <a class="thought" href="entries/cellular_phone_entry.html">cellular phone</a>. There is a tendency to look only at the immediate, everyday-<a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> implications of this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, rather than seeing what lies at the end of the path we are taking. Increasing the <a class="thought" href="entries/bandwidth_entry.html">bandwidth</a> more and more, pulling individuals closer and closer together, are steps in a process that will ultimately lead to the unification of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race.</p>
<p>The high capacity of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> transfer and high level of <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s between individuals is the key to development of a unified total <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>. Physically, though, individuals are likely to remain separate. This is a an important point, as even though the interconnected masses will operate for the advancement of the whole, a degree of individuality and <a class="thought" href="entries/autonomy_entry.html">autonomy</a>, as the individual cells in our body possess, is vital. Furthermore, the flow of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> between individuals will not be entirely unobstructed, as the single mind will not be able to cope with such vast amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. Certain filters will have to be <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> up and maintained to sort out the relevant from the irrelevant <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>.</p>
<p>At some point after the integration of humans and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, an additional step will have to be taken: incorporation of PCD, resulting in disconnection of the weaker links (or individual constituents) from the collective <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. Only once PCD, or the principle underlying it, has been incorporated will it be possible to accomplish the leap to a higher state of <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>--an <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> which is the sum of all the minds connected to the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, and which lies beyond what any of us can imagine.</p>
<p>A related aspect concerns loss of privacy. Will people want this to happen at all? Why would anyone voluntarily relinquish control of an independent <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a>, allowing personal <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, memories and <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> to be shared, at a certain level, by the entire population? The answer, which may sound frightening, is that the obvious choice will be between acceptance of one's integration into the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a> and consequent loss of individualism through joining the super-organism, or remaining separate, outside it. Those not joining will sentence themselves to being the lesser <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> forms of this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, lower on the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary scale. Ponder for one moment the difference between a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and a bacterium.</p>
<p>The pooling of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> may begin with the transferral of all our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. This is already happening on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a>. At a later stage of scientific advancement, a physical connection of humans to the <a class="thought" href="entries/matrix_entry.html">matrix</a> at higher and higher levels (via advances in nervous/<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>) will be possible. Thereafter, with humans completely interconnected through a <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>, questions might arises as to the relevance of the physical world. Could we simply upload all our <a class="thought" href="entries/consciousness_entry.html">consciousness</a> to this virtual world? Would we then create a comparable world inside the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the creation of multicellular organisms can be viewed as an <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary leap. The same might be said about the integration of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to create a wholly interconnected "organism", composed of multitudes of individuals. It will be an immense leap for humanity, or for what it becomes. This idea has been put forward by scientists and by writers of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>. It may be seen as good ("enlightenment through <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s") or bad (will we become the Borg?)--the end of humanity as we know it, a utopia, or both.</p>
<p>It seems, though, that this is not an appropriate question: humanity will have to come to terms with the fact that it is but an insignificant part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>, and as such must conform to its physical and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> laws and their resulting processes, among them <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Whether we like it or not, the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> has come when our <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> has brought us to a doorway, beyond which lies what we cannot grasp by means of our limited, single-<a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a>-power <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>. We cannot possibly fathom the <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s and conscious scope of billions of linked minds, acting together.</p>
<p>This vision may seem horrifying to some, thrilling to others. It is the next major <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary step forward for humanity, and will eventually be taken. However we choose to view this scenario, the fact remains that this is the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> toward which we are inevitably heading.</p>
<p>This is not about good or bad. It is about <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. Humankind must evolve.</p>
<p>Note: This article represents my opinion, based on both <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>ary patterns as they have occurred during the <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> on this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> and the direction in which, in my view, the development of humans and our <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has been moving during the last few centuries. It is, nonetheless, only a personal view. Some of the ideas expressed here represent a scientific consensus, while most are pure conjecture--<a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> if you like.</p>

The term PCD is unfortunate. The concept of 'programmed cell death' is somewhat incompatible with the less evolved concept of 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Very interesting article. It seems as though there will be a certain centrality of information, a melting pot of sorts; and the meeting of the minds as never before. Facts may be strewn about; will this system, the Internet, autimatically correct any misinformation after awhile? And when becoming a major entity, will this assist in the building of a major AI, in which the Turing Test will easily be accomplished by human behavioral replication such as actions, dialects, and slightly questionable meta-opinions?
<br>
Could there be a natural birth of AI much like biological life forms? The next stage of Evolution?</p></td>

<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology might eventually take us there by weakening the bonds of mutual dependence that hold society together, while vastly increasing the power that an individual or small group can wield.  The ability to easily reproduce intelligent machine servants, or even copy humans, reduces the value of forming large coalitions, and tends to emphasize the value of (and hence conflicts over) energy resources.
<br>
<br>
When it becomes possible to produce copies of people (identity becoming multiplicity), large tribes of one or two basic "selves" might come into being, which would be more willing to form a group mind.  Such multiplied egos might also see even less value in outside social interaction, and tend to be more "selfish", resulting in competition between multi-selves, and hence perhaps driving evolution.

<br>
<br>
How about the same pressures that cause the individual cells that became a body to evolve into a networked being with a conscious self?  
<br>
<br>
As I see it, if humanity keeps growing, we will have to develop the same kind of networked intelligence in order to survive.  Every cell in your body is a simple computer capable of creating a copy of itself and processing the food stuff that keeps it alive.  What requires a communication network is the distribution of food and information between all the members of that body.  
<br>
<br>
That's what the planet Earth will require as we keep growing in numbers and complexity.  The alternative is death.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Throughout the history of living organisms, networking has played a pivotal role in evolution.  We have the evolution of the vast interconnection of cell networks to thank for blessing us with the consciousness and sentient intelligence we have today.  Humans have used networks for centuries as a platform for sharing knowledge, although the medium has changed dramatically over time.
<br>
<br>
It's unquestionable that Internet has redefined the entire landscape of communication, and has facilitated our ability, in a sense, to take control of our own evolution.  The theory of one interconnected organism would have unimaginable benefits, as every single piece of known information, including the thoughts of others, could be easily and immediately accessible by anyone else at any time.  However, I believe that privacy and solitude are critical to human development and happiness; we need to have a chance to stop for a moment to reflect on life and organize our thoughts.  As a result, we would need to have the ability to disconnect from this network when we so choose.  Additionally, some information is never meant to be shared with the rest of the world, so the option of protecting our own thoughts and ideas from public access would be necessary.
<br>
<br>
However, I believe that the critical flaw in this conceptual network lies in its basic philosophy, which is 'survival of the fittest'.  To illustrate an example, it could be argued that people in developing countries are weaker than we who are fortunate to live in developed countries, because of our access to healthcare, higher education, etc.  Many individuals and companies in developed countries have pledged resources such as time and money to help end the struggle that these people face every day.  It could also be argued that we could have used these resources instead to further our own advancement while letting these people suffer in their own misery.  However, many would agree that this line of thinking is absurd and even downright nasty.  Unlike a multicellular network, we do not kill off the weaker members of our human network, nor do we attempt to disconnect them from society.  We, unlike the cells we are made of, do not possess the singular focus of survival and evolution at the expense of our own members.  Because of this, Danny Belkin's dream of a single interconnected 'organism' will likely never see the light of day.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This article is fascinating in the potential it presents for the future of humanity. Many would never fathom the possibility of an interconnected mental network especially as a part of natural evolution. Most individuals would believe that if this idea were to come to fruition it would occur through external means of advanced technological devices or services but not through human evolution. When most of us look to the future we rarely look at the potential changes in humans, rather we look at changes in our environment and the technologies we develop to better cope.
<br>
<br>
That being said, it truly is an exciting idea to consider. Imagine sitting down to an exam and being able to lookup information instantaneously in your mind and come up with the answer immediately from a pool of knowledge from billions of other people. This could mean the end of traditional education as we know it. It could also provide direct communication with other individuals anywhere in the world, making mail, telephone and even email obsolete. It could also mean huge potential increases in the ability to advance the capabilities of mankind. Individuals would have a wealth of knowledge from the minds of potentially every other individual on the planet when pondering a problem. The potential possibilities truly are endless.
<br>
<br>
With this would also come certain fears and distrust. Would we be able to guard our own private thoughts? Would we be subject to denial of service attacks (or other attacks) on our minds? Could we be shutdown by a malicious 'mind-hacker' on the other side of the world? The possibility brings many potential fears and worries. If we are connected as computer networks are today, would we not be subject to the security breeches and safety issues that plague the Internet? Much like network security is breeched on a regular basis today, we too could become the target for mental attacks.
<br>
<br>
Although the potential possibilities and benefits of this idea seem remarkable, we must approach the idea with some concern. If Belkin's idea were to come to fruition, we could risk having the malicious attacks currently perpetrated on computer systems perpetrated on individuals like you and I, and unlike a down server that can be re-booted or repaired, the human body may not be as resilient to these attacks.

I, myself, have experienced certain coincidences many times that make me wonder if, under certain conditions, people don't already send and receive the thoughts of others at a distance.
<br>
<br>
If indeed there is a quantum aspect to our brains, perhaps they have an ability to communicate through such related phenomenon.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps there is no quantum effect at all and our brains send out (ultra-high frequency) signals or some sort of radio waves.

Of course anything that increase the "survivability" or enjoyment becomes profitiability. MinitaryNET. As far as giving away your conciousness in an authoritarian domain based system that is already pretty much defined, its called the law. It's not good but I'm talking to the world. Cybernetics and genetics can be seen as the future that along with space flight as you can see in scifi &amp; rpg.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This article definitely presents an intriguing possibility for the future. However, the idea that humanity is moving towards a collective consciousness is merely one of the many competing ideas about the future. Other ideas such as super intelligent robots and humans with cybernetic enhancements also have their own convincing arguments and logic presented by their proponents.
<br>
This begs the question: which of these ideas contains the most viable path that our evolution will take in the future? While I do have my questions about each of these proposals, I would like to focus on the viability of this particular topic for now. Is it truly possible that we humans are nearing the end of having individual consciousnesses and moving towards unification, and even if we are, is it truly adaptive to us as a species?
<br>
In evolutionary psychology, the two primary problems faced by our ancient ancestors living in groups are considered to be 'getting along' and 'getting ahead'. While 'getting along' refers to working with your group to ensure survival, 'getting ahead' means standing out and establishing your identity and power within the group. This is true even to this day. We humans are proud of our individuality. We like to stand out, exhibit our individual talents, and be acknowledged for what we possess. We like to compete, to win and be recognized for it. It can be argued that this is the very reason behind our growth. Scientists competing in their respective fields to make the greatest discoveries, athletes competing to be the best in their sport, companies competing against each other to manufacture the best product and even nations striving to be the mightiest in the world; all driven by competition and the drive to get ahead. But say that we all become part of the same consciousness; one big melting pot. What is left there to drive us forward? We are already the dominant species of the planet, so we can rule out competition from organisms that are lower on the evolutionary scale. If we can't compete against each other, then who do we compete against; aliens? Or is collective consciousness the final step in our evolution, the answer to all of mankind's problems?
<br>
Another point is the question of whether or not to become part of this collective consciousness. The author states that humans will have the choice of joining the collective consciousness or staying outside of it as a lesser life form in the evolutionary scale. However, I do not believe that these are the only choices. To begin with, how many people will willingly give up their individuality? I dare say not very many. Convincing people to give up their individual consciousnesses will not be a very easy thing to do. Also, in the presence of less controversial alternatives for increasing your brain power such as cybernetic implants, collective consciousness may seem less appealing. Given the widespread belief that computer technology would have advanced enough to make processors that can match the processing power of millions of human brains by the latter half of the 21st century, cybernetic implants seem like a very real and viable alternative indeed.
<br>
This is not to say I wholly disagree with the concept of a collective conscious. It does have its benefits such as the sharing of mental resources. However, to be truly viable, I believe that it should somehow allow the individual to retain his or her consciousness, but at the same time have the benefit of having access to the wide resources of others minds. In other words, each of us should be able to draw the line on how much we want to share and just like today's Internet we should have the option of 'disconnecting' ourselves if we wish to do so.

<br>
<br>
I was impressed with the idea of a new level of humanity based on the internet.  It echoed an idea from my faith, the Baha'i Faith, which promotes the idea of the unity of mankind on all levels.  The founder, Baha'u'llah, proclaimed that a mankind had been given the means to create unity, which would facilitate the elimination of misunderstanding.  Strangely enough, he proclaimed these things before such things were available.  The first telegraph message had been sent on the day of the revelation of his precursor (1844)and the first effort at a transatlantic cable was attempted in the year of his own revelation (1853).  However, as he lived most of his adult life as a refugee, exile and prisoner in the Middle East, he had no way of obtaining this information.  Many of his teachings, such as a common script, currency, etc., although unthought of in His lifetime, are ideas that are in the process of becoming accepted ideas worldwide, for ex: the EU, WTO, UN.
<br>
<br>
"A mighty force, a consummate power lieth concealed in the world of being. Fix your gaze upon it and upon its unifying influence, and not upon the differences which appear from it."  
<br>
(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 221)
<br>
<br>
I see these changes in communication of all kinds, internet, telecommunications, and media such as television, etc., as the physical means or medium by which the unification of mankind will take place. The internet is one means to the end, by allowing all men to learn about and accept others of other cultures, races, religions, nationalities, etc.  Knowledge overcomes ignorance, from which develops prejudice and hatred.  The internet also promotes the equal access of all to education of all kinds - languages, science, technical, history, so all are then on an equal playing field.  Communication enhances the ability of businesses to obtain manpower, material and markets, thus providing a network to eliminate want.  It also provides the means for governments to work together toward common goals.
<br>
<br>
On another level, I see this expansion of communication as one evidence of the truth of Baha'u'llah's statement, speaking as a Messenger of God, that God has opened the doors of the sciences:
<br>
<br>
"In like manner, the moment the word expressing My attribute "The Omniscient" issueth forth from My mouth, every created thing will, according to its capacity and limitations, be invested with the power to unfold the knowledge of the most marvelous sciences, and will be empowered to manifest them in the course of time at the bidding of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Knowing."  	(Baha'u'llah, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 142)
<br>
<br>
"Unveiled and unconcealed, this Wronged One hath, at all times, proclaimed before the face of all the peoples of the world that which will serve as the key for unlocking the doors of sciences, of arts, of knowledge, of well-being, of prosperity and wealth." (Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 96)
<br>
<br>
"Erelong shall We bring into being through thee exponents of new and wondrous sciences, of potent and effective crafts, and shall make manifest through them that which the heart of none of Our servants hath yet conceived. (Baha'u'llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 35)
<br>
<br>
I can guess what many might think of this, but if you look at copy of "The Economist" published less than two years ago, you will find a chart demonstrating that right around 1844, right after someone proposed closing the U.S. Patent Office, inventions blossomed and have continued to do so at a rate completely unheard of previously.
<br>
<br>
We will also, through all these means of communication, have the opportunity to search the words of the founders of all the world religions and discover that the essential spiritual teachings of all are the same, allowing men to comprehend that they are all related, not only genetically, as has been shown, but as children of the same God, therefore all equal.  
<br>
<br>
This expanded communication is also allowing all to learn about this new world faith, the values and teachings of which are identical to the essential teachings of the other religions and are the means of uniting mankind on the spiritual level, and which has provided new guidance specifically for this modern age, which earlier messengers did not address.  Baha'u'llah has specifically stated that religion and science must be in harmony as the two wings of a bird:

<br>
<br>
"The Great Being saith: The learned of the day must direct the people to acquire those branches of knowledge which are of use, that both the learned themselves and the generality of mankind may derive benefits therefrom."	(Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 168)
<br>
<br>
Understanding this principle will help to erase the superstitous beliefs that result from the misunderstanding of teachings and that are at heart essential spiritual in nature.  This will in the long run contribute as well to greater unity.  Thus we will be able to act as a single organism with global understanding and goals.
<br>
<br>
"In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in human life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and will harmoniously develop."	(Baha'u'llah, The Proclamation of Baha'u'llah, p. xi)

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I would have to agree with Mr. Belkin.  A networked existence is definitely the next step in our neurological evolution.  Humankind is obsessed with progress, we need it, and we need it now.  Natural evolution takes thousands upon thousands of generations and with life spans increasing as Belkin mentions, it will take us millennia to leap to the next step of evolution.  It's simply not fast enough.  This fact combined with our thirst for knowledge, leads me to the conclusion that our species is going to supplement the mind with a technological booster kit.  An article by New Scientist (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194610/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4262)" target="_blank">http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4262)  </a> shows that we've already tried this on apes.  In this study they attached a chip to the monkey's brain that allowed it to control a third arm, that's not too far off from surgically implanting a chip to allow a user to surf the internet from any location.  The pursuit of knowledge is what drives us as a species.  A couple hundred years ago, the common man would spend his entire life amassing the knowledge that we presently learn in first two decades of our life.  Pythagorean spent his life developing trigonometry and it's taught to us in high school in four months.  We're near the limit of what we can learn by reading it in books, or having it taught to us by an instructor.  These practices take time and we're impatient.  The only way to make learning faster is to skip all the unnecessary steps and download it straight into our brains, or have it readily available stored across a nation's worth of minds.  
<br>
	The biggest hurdle in the realization of this goal is that we can't lose our individuality.  I have no doubt in my mind that a collective consciousness would lead to an overall high intelligence across all the populace, but without individual genius our innovations will be hindered.  The theory of relativity wasn't the brain child of a town's worth of people; it was the product of an intellectual outlier who had the individual creativity to produce what is now a foundation of modern science.  Like the Borg in Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, we will no longer be able to compile or own new knowledge; we'll be forced to steal it from outside sources.  Just like evolution theory states (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071011194610/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/)," target="_blank">http://evolution.berkeley.edu/),</a> a species without variation, without individualism is doomed for failure.
<br>
	Hopefully, like the internet, this network of minds will have an off switch so we can disconnect from time to time.  Spend a lonely moment reading a book, or watching a movie.  But there's no if, ands or buts about it, this will happen, and it will happen relatively soon.  I for one will embrace the change and hopefully so will everyone else.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>this article was a bit of a shock to me when i just stumbled across it... 
<br>
before I had read anything like this before I had had a dream about a year ago that was essentially me living through this evolutionary process allmost exactly as its explained here. It was as if every year of evolution took about a minute for me to completely understand, and the dream went on for hours. we were able to advance the human brain with both technology and biological means (i.e. more advanced biological brain matter, not just computer implants, but allso genetic engineering of our brain. don't we only use 10% of our brain anyway?)the cool part about this dream was, i could actually understand the complexity of everyones minds working together, as well as every living system on earth. as science advanced our ability to comprehend the information, i was able to think on higher levels within my dream. this system of connected minds could learn anything at an ever increasing rate. weather patterns could be predicted with infinite precision, allmost everything could be learned instantly, and for a few brief moments before I woke up, I knew everything. the entire system of life on earth essentially went from infinate complexity to the ultimate simplicity of 1 supreme being. (which included all life forms and all matter, not just humans) I'm not really a spritual person, but in this dream all the religions of the world became one and the same, and as we all became enlightned we essentially became god. (yet each individual was their own god) If only i had a computer program that could have explained my thoughts in the few brief moments before the dream started to fade. when I first woke up it still all made perfect sense, and I immediatly wanted to write a book about it. But I had to get up and go to work, and the details quickly faded and now I've honestly forgotten most of it. One thing i know was that even though the entire system was 1 connected being, each person still had their individuality and the ability to think independently and have our own private thoughts.
<br>
<br>
some other wierd coincidences... I hadn't put much thought into this dream since it occured over a year ago, but i happend to bring it up in a conversation to my gf yesterday and then surfed onto this article by accident today. i was bored and did a google search for "ideas" and found this article, which is basically a narration of my dream explained much more clearly then i could ever explain it. I tried and failed to explain it yesterday, and won't bother again today...anyway, i figured I'd post my thoughts...
<br>

you might think i'm an idiot in reality, but i'm a genius when i'm sleeping</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>It seems to me like some people here have missed the point about the development of a collective conscious as if it were a 'decision' that could or should be made. What I believe and what I think Belkin may be hinting at is that a collective conscious already exists (albeit in an infantile state) and its further development is inevitable.
<br>
 The way I see it we do not all need to be linked through some technology based telepathic network through which we can instantly access the thoughts of everyone else on earth anymore than a cell on the tip of your finger needs to know the exact state of a cell in you brain in order for them to act in accord and be part of the same living organism. Instead it suffices for a cell to perform its own specific function in relation to other nearby cells which in the broad scheme of things is how our bodies and brains work. 
<br>
<br>
Using symbols, text and audio to transmit information amongst one another is enough especially when coupled with the capability for mass data storage and retrieval ie 'memory' (the amount of information committed to books and computers is far more than any one man could ever claim to have read or understand).  Each 'cell' or person needs only to think and act in terms of his immediate surroundings and personal beliefs, the important thing being that the effect of his actions is linked via a network to the rest of humanity. The globalization of trade is perhaps the most immediate example of this. Every time you purchase something it has an effect no matter how imperceptible (say no more than the effect of a single brain cell on your ability to make a decision) on the state of the global economy. 1000 years ago this was not the case. There is no inherent need for us to achieve a higher and more intrusive state of linkage. 
<br>
<br>
The question really is whether there is a certain level of complexity and connectivity that needs to be reached in order for a 'consciousness' to emerge. In the case of cells it was a long time between the first multi celled organism and the creation of advanced  brains capable of conscious thought and we still have no idea at which point this consciousness emerged. What we are witnessing now however seems to be a critical period of maturation for the human organism. Certainly instantaneous data transfer and an awareness of all other people on earth (ie no more lost worlds to discover) would seem to be very important steps and a sign that we are moving into a new stage. 
<br>
 This collective conscious could have been 'born' with the development of language and writing and through the gradual development of society and communication it is evolving/growing up into a more complex organism which is now capable of making conscious decisions and who knows maybe even of being self aware. Anything which affects the survival of the human organism as a whole (think global warming, nuclear energy etc) tends to be the result of a collective decision; a pooling of resources and opinions hence Belkin pointing out the power of the media on government policy etc. In essence who is making these decisions? It is most certainly not as many people would have you believe exclusively the domain of individual politicians and power brokers. I see no reason not to think of a conscious entity using its brain (a network of symbols and triggers continuously communicating and affecting each other) to come to a decision. What difference does it make if each cell also has its own 'brain' full of cells and who knows perhaps this concept may help to explain things occurring on a quantum level within our own minds.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>One conclusion that seems errant in this article is the need for a person or individual to relinquish their individuality or autonomy to the "collective human consciousness"  
<br>
<br>
If anything, it would seem that the creation of the collective information available by the internet would simply enhance the ability to more quickly become ones'
<br>
individual self and express that accordingly.
<br>
<br>
It would seem to me that the creation of guttenberg's press did not dehumanize or  bury the individual, but enhanced the individuals creativity and capability to contribute to society through the written word.  The same holds true of the creation of the internet and  a "collective consciousness". What one can do and see and feel can be "more" real, "more" authentic, "more" enlightening rather than less.
<br>
<br>
Go and take a look at "myspace.com" this obviously popular offshoot of the internet has allowed people to enhance their individuality along with feeling connected to and express themsevles to each in ways that heretofore were unimaginable.
<br>
<br>
Just my opinion here.</p></td>
