<p>Humans can't really know all that much. They only have the particular experiences they have had, and those can differ by quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> from the experience of the next guy. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has the benefit of all of the experiences that any <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of humans is likely to tell to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>The real question is whether we want them to decide. My career has encompassed many different areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> design and deployment, but always this question persists: <i>will people let <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s decide?</i> When I was working in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>), we began to realize that we could create <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s that not only could decide, but would likely to be able to decide better than humans can. Now that I work in the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, we realize we can create courses that will function quite nicely without any <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> instructor involved, yet always we are confronted with: <i>What about the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> </i><i><a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a></i><i>?</i> and <i>Will the student be evaluated by a </i><i><a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a></i><i>?</i> These are related issues. Let me explain why. I will start with <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> came of age with the advent of <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a>s. These <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s were rule-based and attempted to capture the rules that a decision maker uses when making a <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-based decision like where to drill for oil or how to diagnose a disease. These <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s worked passably well, but they never got smart as a result of their experiences and thus never really rivaled a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> decision maker in a complex domain.</p>
<p>The next generation of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> decision making <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s were <a class="thought" href="entries/case_based_reasoning_entry.html">case-based reasoning</a> (CBR) <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s that employed cases instead of rules. They <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ed by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> to prior experience and could integrate new experiences into their <a class="thought" href="entries/database_entry.html">database</a>, thus getting smarter with each new attempt at <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing. A good CBR <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> depends upon having thousands of cases indexed in complex ways so that just the right experience can "come to mind" at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Thus, a good CBR <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> could really "know" more and retrieve what it knows better than a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> could.</p>
<p>CBR <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s could get good enough so that you might want a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> decision maker to decide U.S. foreign policy. <i>What a terrible idea,</i> say the scoffers. But, real decision makers <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> from cases too and sometimes they make profound case-based errors (my favorite being the use of the Pueblo incident as a precedent to help President Ford decide what to do in the Mayaguez incident--a match that only made <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> because both involved Spanish-named ships). A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> would presumably be more consistent, less liable to <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a> and stress, more mindful of historical precedent, more generally <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able of prior cases and much less likely to have had a bad night's sleep or a fight with its wife.</p>
<p>We found however, in the process of building CBR <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, that people were afraid of them. No one, it seemed, wanted <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s to take over, or to make hard decisions without a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> "in the loop" watching out to see that a good decision was made. The problem with this is that a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can have a much larger case base than any one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> can, so large that it would be hard to imagine that a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> would know whether the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> had made a good decision or not. Humans can't really know all that much. They only have the particular experiences they have had, and those can differ by quite a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> from the experience of the next guy. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> has the benefit of all of the experiences that any <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> of humans is likely to tell to the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to the field in which I currently work. For some years now I have been building <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, not the <i>drill and kill</i> kind, but the kind that allows for a learn by doing experience in a complex simulated environment. I do not believe that <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> is well served by lectures, by <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> versions of lecture courses, or by the general approach to <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> that says that swallowing whole heaps of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and showing how much you have swallowed on a multiple choice test means anything at all. We learn from experience, interrupted by good <i>just in <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> teaching</i> (storytelling really). <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">Software</a> that is well-designed can create just the kind of experiential <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> (think of air <a class="thought" href="entries/flight_simulator_entry.html">flight simulator</a>s) that is so hard to find in a book or in a classroom.</p>
<p>We have been building this <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> for some <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, and now, after having started to work with Columbia University to build high quality university level courses, we are offering those courses to high schools around the country. The idea is that in a country where the football coach is the most likely candidate to teach <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and where a <a class="thought" href="entries/psychology_entry.html">psychology</a> course is ne'er to be found in any but the fanciest of highs schools, it might make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> to start migrating high-quality learn by doing online courses from a top university into the highs schools. This might make <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a>, and to some high schools it does, but most cry foul. <i>You mean there won't be a teacher present? How will the student learn? We can't not have a teacher. What if we put a teacher in the classroom where the students are online?</i> Well, the whole idea of online courses is that they can be taken any <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> anywhere and one would assume that the last place to take them would be at an assigned <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> in classroom. Further, who are they going to put in there? We are offering <a class="thought" href="entries/c_plus_plus_entry.html">C++</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/java_entry.html">JAVA</a> courses because they don't have instructors in high school who can teach these courses. Does this deter them from putting a teacher in there? No, of course not. They just try to put a teacher in who "isn't any good anyhow" and who "normally teaches something else," just so there will be a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> present.</p>
<p>For years I have started my classes by asking students if they <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> and I was always told that they couldn't. I then would claim that I was actually a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and ask if they believed I could <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>. They said I could but, of course didn't believe that I was a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. I accused them of being "fleshists," that is, of being prejudiced against <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> that are not made of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> flesh. The sad story is that we all somehow seem to believe that humans are better at <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>ing than a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could ever be, which is clearly false, or better at teaching than a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> could ever be, which is also clearly false. Of course, there are some pretty exceptional humans, but there are also some pretty bad ones. I say we give the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s the chance to show their stuff.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-based online world which we are about to enter can be very powerful. We can be pretty sure that politicians, teachers, and other people with vested interests will do very little to help this world come about because they are afraid of being replaced. They are not going to be replaced by superior beings of course--that stuff is the stuff of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>. They could, on the other hand, be replaced in tasks that are simply too much for any one <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> to bear. Making complex decisions based on tremendous amounts of <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> would seem to be one of these. Another is bringing all the world's <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> to bear to help out a student in just the right way at just the right <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. Well-intentioned teachers may simply not know enough or be able to spend the individual one on one <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that a student might need. We have <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when the teacher was the most <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able person in a community or school. We have also <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>ed beyond the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> when decision makers can rely on their own experience or the experience of their assistants to deal with a complex environment. We must stop being fleshists and encourage the building of these kinds of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s as well as their deployment.</p>
