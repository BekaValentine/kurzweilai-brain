<p><i>This is an excerpt of an article originally published on </i><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100614005043/http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_2.html#kurzweil" target="_blank">Edge</a>
<i>January 1, 2006</i>.<i> Published with permission on KurzweilAI.net 
              January 17, 2006.</i></p>
<p>My dangerous idea is the near-term inevitability of radical <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> 
              extension and expansion. The idea is dangerous, however, only when 
              contemplated from current <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a> perspectives. </p>
<p>First the inevitability: the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> technologies 
              is doubling each year, and moreover comprises areas beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, 
              most notably our <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> and of our own <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. 
              It took 15 years to sequence HIV and from that perspective the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> 
              project seemed impossible in 1990. But the amount of genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> 
              we were able to sequence doubled every year while the cost came 
              down by half each year.</p>
<p>We finished the genome project on schedule and were able to sequence 
              SARS in only 31 days. We are also gaining the means to reprogram 
              the ancient information processes underlying biology. <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> interference 
              can turn genes off by blocking the messenger RNA that express them. 
              New forms of gene therapy are now able to place new genetic information 
              in the right place on the right <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>. We can create or block 
              enzymes, the work horses of biology. We are reverse-<a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering&#8212;and 
              gaining the means to reprogram&#8212;the information processes underlying 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and aging, and this process is accelerating, doubling every 
              year. If we think linearly, then the idea of turning off all disease 
              and aging processes appears far off into the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> just as the 
              genome project did in 1990. On the other hand, if we factor in the 
              doubling of the power of these technologies each year, the prospect 
              of radical <a class="thought" href="entries/life_extension_entry.html">life extension</a> is only a couple of decades away.</p>
<p>In addition to reprogramming biology, we will be able to go substantially 
              beyond biology with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> in the form of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>ized <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s 
              in the bloodstream. If the idea of <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>mable <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s the size 
              of blood cells performing therapeutic functions in the bloodstream 
              sounds like far off <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>, I would point out that we are 
              doing this already in <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s. One scientist cured type I diabetes 
              in rats with blood <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> sized devices containing 7 nanometer pores 
              that let insulin out in a controlled fashion and that block antibodies. 
              If we factor in the exponential advance of computation and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> 
              (<a class="thought" href="entries/price_performance_entry.html">price-performance</a> multiplying by a factor of a billion in 25 years 
              while at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> shrinking in size by a factor of thousands), 
              these scenarios are highly realistic.</p>
<p>The apparent dangers are not real while unapparent dangers are 
              real. The apparent dangers are that a dramatic <a class="thought" href="entries/reduction_entry.html">reduction</a> in the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> rate will create over population and thereby strain <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> 
              and other resources while exacerbating environmental degradation. 
              However we only need to capture 1 percent of 1 percent of the sunlight 
              to meet all of our energy needs (3 percent of 1 percent by 2025) 
              and nanoengineered solar panels and fuel cells will be able to do 
              this, thereby meeting all of our energy needs in the late 2020s 
              with clean and renewable <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s. Molecular nanoassembly devices 
              will be able to manufacture a wide range of products, just about 
              everything we need, with inexpensive tabletop devices. The power 
              and price-performance of these <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s will double each year, much 
              faster than the doubling rate of the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> population. As a 
              result, <a class="thought" href="entries/poverty_entry.html">poverty</a> and pollution will decline and ultimately vanish 
              despite <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the biological population.</p>
<p>There are real downsides, however, and this is not a <a class="thought" href="entries/utopian_entry.html">utopian</a> vision. 
              We have a new existential threat today in the potential of a bioterrorist 
              to engineer a new biological <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a>. We actually do have the knowledge 
              to combat this problem (for example, new vaccine technologies and 
              RNA interference which has been shown capable of destroying arbitrary 
              biological viruses), but it will be a race. We will have similar 
              issues with the feasibility of self-replicating nanotechnology in 
              the late 2020s. Containing these perils while we harvest the promise 
              is arguably the most <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant issue we face.</p>
<p>Some people see these prospects as dangerous because they threaten 
              their view of what it means to be <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a>. There is a fundamental 
              philosophical divide here. In my view, it is not our limitations 
              that define our humanity. Rather, we are the <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that seeks 
              and succeeds in going beyond our limitations.</p>

<br>
Codswallop. Only IF we aquire the right funding, then MAYBE we'll have a shot at radical life extension. But alas the funding isn't there.
<br>
<br>
The world doesn't work the way Ray describes. This sort of complacency ("Hang in there! The technology for radical life extension is within our grasp!") does much more harm than good in the long run. If we want radical life extension within the next 50 years, a great deal of funding and public awareness MUST happen NOW. Even with the rapid exponential growth in effectiveness in medical technology, the chances are it'll be still too late for aging to be conquered within our generation. Ray underestimates the complexity of biology and overestimates the ability of technology to manage this complexity.</p></td>

Rays idea is not dangerous, it is an intelligent summation and assessment of already existing technological realities, and the affects those realities will have on the human species.  In the history of technology, there is virtually no precedent for a technology being rejected when it "enhances the quality, scope, and length" of human life.  From the Flint knife or stone hammer to the synthetic techno-humans of the near future,
<br>
all technologies that helped people live broader and more interesting lives, have ultimately succeeded. The fact is that scientists have extended the lives of roundworms by seventeem times their lifespan is not a fantasy it is a  scientific reality. Needless to say we need to assess and proceed judiciously with life extension,and a greater integration of humans and technology with nanotechnology and the like but the bottom line, is that it is going to happen.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>MysticMonkeyGuru is not saying radical life extension will not happen. He is merely saying that our generation will not live long enough to be able to use such technology to life indefinitely. This seems to be the general consensus of opinion in the medical profession. I have read several articles published in reputable sources by gerentologists. All say that the evidence is that aging is a physical process that can be dealt with, but the complexity of that process is such that breakthroughs are not expected for several decades.
<br>
<br>
Mind you, experts said the Internet would not amount to anything of signifance for 1000 years..
<br>
<br>
As for his opinion that there is no funding for radical life extension, that is not strictly true. Yes, there are very few researchers explicitely tackling the goal of extreme life extension. But on the other hand there is a tremendous practical, ethical and moral imperative to find ways to alleviate, prevent, reverse the mryiad ways in which the body can fail at its base level. This pursuit of knowledge is revealing to us an understanding of the human body at the molecular level. Since the aging process is a physical process ocurring at the molecular level, there must come a time when medical science (aided by the all-pervading trend toward Drexlerian nanotechnology) converge on the ways and means to conquer old age.

Cancer and AIDS research get far more funding than life-extension and you just have to look at the statistical deaths from those diseases to see the problems haven't gone away.  Depending on the singularity to suddenly fix all our problems is an irresponsible and dangerous mentality for the people that live in the here and now.  There are biological hurdles that must be overcome, if there weren't, then the technology would already exist.  It's nice to just think we can put nanobots in our blood and all will be good but I have seen nothing truly remarkable created in this field yet.  Yes there are basic little advances but basic advances aren't the problem, because they're easy and don't require overcoming the most difficult challenges we have.  As my biochemistry professor once told us, the easy questions have been answered, the hard ones remain, and that's why novel biological breakthroughs have slowed down, even as computation power accelerates.  
<br>
<br>
People poorly made predictions in the past because they were missing many facts about the world around them.  While we don't know everything, we know a lot more now and can make more accurate predictions, if this wasn't true, then Ray has no business in trying to predict the future.  I don't believe there will suddenly be a leap from living to 75 on average to living 1000 years.  There has to be a transition and it's not going to come overnight.  I see people debating physics all the time on this site, and nanotechnology, but when it comes down to the biology, where are all the advances, the accurate predictions, and why have we done so little already?  I don't want to just have faith in some abstract idea that hasn't been proven, I want to see real breatkthroughs, real advances, because I live in reality, here and now, not 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 years from now.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Yes, but that is pretty much Kurzweil's take on how longevity will be achieved. He does not say that we will leap to lifespans of 1000 years in a single bound. He believes that there are techniques being developed in labs right now that may give us just that little bit of extra time that takes us to slightly better techniques that further delay 'the inevitable' and so on ad infinitum.
<br>
<br>
Kebooo's belief that the idea of longevity is one without proof is mistaken. As evidence of this, consider this quote, taken from an article by David Sinclair and Lenny Guarente called 'unlocking the secrets of longevity genes'.
<br>
<br>
'Because people have sought to slow aging for thousands of years without success, some may find it hard to accept that human aging might be controlled by tweaking a handful of genes. (Yet) without knowing the precise, and potentially mryiad, causes of aging, we have already demonstrated in a variety of life-forms that it can be delayed by manipulating a few regulators and letting them take care of organism's health.
<br>
<br>
We also know that SIR2 genes evolved far beack in time because they are found in organisms ranging from yeast, roundworms, flies and humans. In all these organisms but the last, which has not been tested, Sirtuins dictate length of life. This fact alone convinces us that human Sirtuin genes probably hold the key to our health and longevity as well.
<br>
<br>
Both our labs are running carefully controlled mouse experiments that should soon tell us whether the SIRT1 gene controls health and life span in a mammal. We will not know definitively how Sirtuin genes affect human longevity for decades'.
<br>
<br>
So there IS evidence to back up the idea that lifespans can be extended beyond what we now consider the 'natural' limit, and this is far from the only research that I could have quoted from. As to that timespan of 'decades' before we fully understand its affect (if any) on humans..well it's cutting it a bit close to the bone for the likes of Kurzweil, eh? His response to this is that other areas of sci-tech will inevitably bring forth new equipment that will rapidly improve our ability to perform the necessary work, so that what once would have required 'decades' can be performed in months..weeks..days..minutes. 
<br>
<br>
Again, to show there is some evidence to back up such a claim, consider that a new machine is due to go on the market that could read a person's genome in a day, whereas current machines would require decades. Furthermore, although one machine will set you back a cool million pounds, a rapid price drop is expected once mass-production begins.
