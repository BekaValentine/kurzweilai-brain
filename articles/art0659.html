<div class="TeaserText">Some of the problems of today's globalized world could be eliminated or reduced by developing operational worldwide molecular design and manufacturing capabilities. Instead of shipping physical objects, their detailed design specification in a "Molecular Description Language" (MDL) will be transmitted over a global data grid evolved from today's Internet and then physically "printed" by "nano printers" at remote sites. This would allow communities wishing to remain independent to retain their autonomy.

<p>In this essay, I wish to raise my concern over some of the problems 
              of today's world, and try to suggest how they can be eliminated, 
              or at least their negative impact be reduced, by developing <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>al 
              worldwide molecular design and manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/unabomber_entry.html">Unabomber</a> Manifesto ("Industrial <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> And Its <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">Future</a>") 
              by Theodore Kaczynski is one of the most interesting documents of 
              our times, in terms of both its <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> and its <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>. Thanks 
              to the work of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information Technology</a> pioneers such as some of the 
              people he targeted, you can read the full text of the Unabomber 
              Manifesto online.</p>
<p>Quoting from the <i>Wikipedia</i> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main argument of Industrial Society and Its Future is that 
                technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is undesirable, can be stopped, and in 
                fact should be stopped in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to free people from the unnatural 
                demands of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, so that they can return to a happier, simpler 
                <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> close to <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>. Kaczynski argued that it was necessary to 
                cause a "social crash", before society became any worse. 
                He believes a collapse of <a class="thought" href="entries/civilization_entry.html">civilization</a> is likely to occur at some 
                point in the future; thus, it is better to end things now, rather 
                than later, because the further society develops, the more painful 
                things will be when the collapse occurs. If it does not occur, 
                he says, humans will have the <a class="thought" href="entries/freedom_entry.html">freedom</a> and significance of house 
                pets, although they may be happy, in a society dominated by <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
                or an elite social class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am (and you are, I hope) definitely against Kaczynski's final 
              determinations. However, I have to agree with most critics who say 
              that the Manifesto is very well written and that its conclusions, 
              flawed as they are and despite the horrible acts of murder they 
              spawned, are based on a well articulated analysis of some of the 
              problems of today's world.</p>
<p>One of Kaczynski's central points is that the "natural" 
              social and cultural environment for a <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being is a relatively 
              small community, not too dependent on the outside world for any 
              necessary resource, where everyone has a chance to know everyone 
              else and to actively contribute to the life of the community. He 
              claims that an interconnected world in which the quality of each 
              person's life depends on things that take place far away is dehumanizing 
              and cannot work without decreasing the freedom, the rights, and 
              ultimately the happiness and well-being of people. He argues that 
              the very technologies needed to sustain a globalized world contribute 
              to creating more dehumanization. This produces a runaway feedback 
              loop that can only result in an unnatural environment, putting far 
              too much strain on our mental resources&#8212;and at some point, 
              something has to break.</p>
<p>So, Kaczynski wishes to go back to a world of loosely connected, 
              relatively independent small communities. But this is difficult 
              because in today's world no small community could ever produce all 
              that is needed to meet its own <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a>, food, <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>s, and 
              health care requirements. Hence, Kaczynski proposes to break the 
              technological foundations of our global civilization by any means, 
              including murder.</p>
<p>The deep interconnectedness of today's world also creates huge 
              geopolitical tensions. The situation in the Middle East is a sad 
              example of what can happen when the economy of one region is too 
              strongly dependent on resources located in another region, and where 
              too many players seek control over the complex <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>-wide production 
              and distribution <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s crucial to the functioning of our global 
              infrastructure.</p>
<p>(A big advantage of solar energy, and one of the main <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s why 
              its deployment should be pursued much more aggressively, is that 
              it can be produced locally by those who require it. A nation following 
              this route would sharply reduce their vulnerability to hostile <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>s, 
              and to the blackmail of others based on threatening to disrupt their 
              energy supply. In addition, this would reduce that nation's propensity 
              to wage war against others for the control of energy supplies.)</p>
<p>I definitely do not want to go back to a pre-industrial age as 
              Kaczynski proposes. Indeed, I like many aspects of <a class="thought" href="entries/globalization_entry.html">globalization</a>. 
              I like that in some <a class="thought" href="entries/sense_entry.html">sense</a> we can all regard ourselves as citizens 
              of One World. I like that with the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> I can know what happens 
              and what people think on the other side of the planet, and that 
              I can participate in virtual communities held together by common 
              interests and values instead of geographic location. I like to see 
              thinkers and doers from all over the world working together at near-<a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a> 
              speed to develop new ideas and goods.</p>
<p>So, I am definitely not a sympathizer of the anti-globalization 
              movement. But I can see worth in some of the points they make, partly 
              based on Kaczynski's writings. Perhaps we can take their best arguments 
              into account by recognizing that although the option of living in 
              a global interconnected world is good for many, nobody should be 
              forced to do so, and a local community of like-minded people who 
              wish to live their lives in relative isolation from the rest of 
              the world&#8212;provided of course they do not oppress their citizens 
              or threaten other communities&#8212;should have the opportunity and 
              the means to do so. A good, albeit perhaps extreme, example is in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/broderick_entry.html">Damien Broderick</a>'s <i>Transcension</i>.</p>
<p>Another problem of the modern world is that it is very difficult 
              to build effective supranational governance bodies, because existing 
              nation-states, especially those with a long history, refuse to give 
              up sovereignty and power. This difficulty is often seen in the United 
              Nations and in other supranational bodies such as the European Union. 
              Few, if any, of today's nation-states would seriously consider allowing 
              such organizations to have real and effective decision-making power, 
              let alone the means to enforce the decisions made. It appears that 
              a gradual breakup of existing nation states into smaller entities, 
              relatively autonomous but co-operating when co-operation is necessary 
              for all parties involved, will be a necessary prerequisite for the 
              creation of supranational governance <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s including regional 
              and world "governments".</p>
<p>I have given two different but connected arguments for "small is 
              beautiful." And, speaking of small things, I believe that emerging 
              NBIC<a name="ref"></a><a href="#foot">*</a> technologies, and in 
              particular molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, will offer the opportunity 
              to retain the benefits of globalization while at the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> significantly 
              reducing the dependence of local communities on the external world 
              as far as the availability of material goods (food, <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>s, energy, 
              vehicles, toys, designer items, etc.) is concerned.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/feynman_entry.html">Richard Feynman</a> was the first to articulate the possibility of 
              molecular nanotechnology (although not by that name). In his 1959 
              essay, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," he argued 
              that there is nothing in the laws of <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> to prevent us from 
              building molecular size machines able to precisely place <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              atoms and <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s according to design specifications and build 
              complex structures and chemical compounds one <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a> at a time. Feynman 
              wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be, in principle, possible (I think) for a physicist 
                to synthesize any chemical substance that the chemist writes down. 
                Give the orders and the physicist synthesizes it. How? Put the 
                atoms down where the chemist says, and so you make the substance. 
                The problems of <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> can be greatly helped if 
                our ability to see what we are doing, and to do things on an atomic 
                level, is ultimately developed&#8212;a development which I think 
                cannot be avoided.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Drexler, who coined the term "nanotechnology" and 
              popularized it in <i><a class="thought" href="entries/engines_of_creation_entry.html">Engines of Creation</a>&#8212;The Coming Era of 
              Nanotechnology</i>, was among the first to realize that nanotechnology 
              will achieve its disruptive potential when molecular machines will 
              be able to build other molecular machines by assembling them from 
              atoms and molecules available in their environment. Given <a class="thought" href="entries/replicant_entry.html">replicant</a> 
              nanotechnology, it is easy to see how, with suitable <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>ming 
              and assuming that all needed molecular "bricks" can be 
              extracted from the environment (a safe assumption in most cases), 
              it is possible to assemble any substance or structure for which 
              detailed design specifications are available. So, our future economy 
              will not be based on material goods, but on design specifications 
              for material goods. We already have examples of this today:</p>
<p>A document can be transmitted over the Internet and reproduced, 
              on screen or on paper, by whomever has to read it. This technology 
              is available to nearly all consumers, at least in the Western world, 
              at the (relatively) low cost of a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>, a <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>, and an Internet 
              connection.</p>
<p>A VHDL (VHSIC <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> description <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a>) design specification 
              for an application specific <a class="thought" href="entries/integrated_circuit_entry.html">integrated circuit</a> is as good as the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> itself in the sense that it can be taken to a suitable hardware 
              foundry and used to reproduce the device with an automated process. 
              The fundamental difference from the previous example is that today 
              one needs very complex and expensive machinery and extensive know-how 
              to generate a physical instantiation of the device. But I think 
              we can safely predict that the costs will drop and <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a> printing 
              will become more and more like document printing.</p>
<p>Instead of shipping physical <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s, their detailed design specification 
              in a "Matter Description Language" or "Molecular 
              Description Language" (MDL) will be transmitted over a global 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> grid evolved from today's Internet and then physically instantiated 
              ("printed") by "nano printers" at remote sites. 
              The usage of nano printers, also called nanofactories, is described 
              in Neal Stephenson's <i>The Diamond Age</i>. The term "<a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">Matter</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/compiler_entry.html">Compiler</a>" 
              (MC) used by Stephenson in the <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> is especially good as, by <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> 
              with the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> development process, it suggests the idea of organizing 
              (compiling) matter from design specifications. Reading Stephenson's 
              descriptions of young Nell trying to use her mother's cheap kitchen 
              MC to compile clothes, toys, and mattresses makes it easier to understand 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a>s of molecular manufacturing.</p>
<p>Assuming it still exists at that time, the Coca Cola Company will 
              not sell physical cans, but will license the MDL description of 
              its popular beverage for on-site compilation by customers. I assume 
              Coca Cola and all other <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> companies will need some means 
              to enforce their <a class="thought" href="entries/intellectual_property_entry.html">intellectual property</a> rights to make sure that 
              customers pay what they are supposed to pay. This probably will 
              be done by a limit on the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of times a given MDL design can 
              be assembled by a given user, with protection technologies conceptually 
              similar to those used today for <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Rights Management (DRM). 
              Of course, there will be plenty of 15 year-old <a class="thought" href="entries/hacker_entry.html">hacker</a>s willing and 
              able to crack whatever DRM protection scheme manufacturers can think 
              of, and then make available cracked DRM-free design specs on the 
              global data grid.</p>
<p>I do not see any reason why molecular nanotechnology should change 
              the basic laws of economy, so I assume that the MDL description 
              of an Armani suit will cost as much as the Armani suit costs today. 
              And I believe tomorrow's designers of luxury items will be perfectly 
              entitled to charge a lot of money for their creations. But what 
              happens if the MDL descriptions of basic goods that a local community 
              needs are priced beyond their reach? And what happens if these licenses 
              are withdrawn for political reasons, perhaps to force a community 
              to submit to an aggressor community or to an overreaching central 
              authority?</p>
<p>Basic goods should be free, or priced within the means of everyone. 
              In other words, Coca Cola can be expensive, but water must be free. 
              Armani suits can be expensive, but basic clothing must be free. 
              Who will develop royalty-free MDL descriptions of basic goods that 
              everyone on the planet can use? The answer, I think (or at least 
              I hope), is that they will be developed with an <a class="thought" href="entries/open_source_entry.html">Open Source</a> development 
              model by armies of MDL programmers.</p>

              as one of the best examples of Open Source development; and second, 
              <i>Wikipedia</i> articles are as good as, and often better than, 
              equivalent articles in expensive encyclopedias. I can rest assured 
              that all <i>Wikipedia</i> references that I use in this article 
              will be maintained under the spontaneous quality assurance and control 
              processes that are emerging within the <i>Wikipedia</i> community, 
              and will be further improved by countless users and experts. So, 
              linking to <i>Wikipedia</i> is much safer than linking to a commercial 
              website that may disappear if the owner goes out of business. (If 
              you are reading a hardcopy version of this essay and wish to have 
              further <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> on the terms and concepts mentioned, please 
              go to the URL <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090107051231/http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> 
              and enter your <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/keyword_entry.html">keyword</a>s.)</p>
<p>It seems likely that many of the arguments used today in favor 
              of the Open Source movement will be applicable to tomorrow's <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> 
              economy. The availability of Open Source MDL specifications for 
              all basic goods will result, I believe, in a better world&#8212;a 
              world where citizens and communities will be free to do their own 
              thing (provided they do not reduce the right and ability of others 
              to do the same) without having to give in to pressure and blackmail 
              from hostile parties or meddlesome central authorities who threaten 
              to disrupt their supply of basic material goods.</p>

<br>
<br>
Over 99% of the species which have ever existed on our planet are extinct. This is because they have either evolved into something else or died out.
<br>
<br>
It would be the epitome of arrogance to assume modern humans are the exception to this evolutionary process.
<br>
<br>
My credo is "Evolve". I am anxious to experience what lies ahead, though I must confess to harbor some dread. The urge to cut and run is quelled by knowledge of where I came from. There is no turning back. Why return to the barbaric past? 
<br>
<br>
So, I welcome change, uncertainty and evolution. Why? Because throughout the ages, other alternatives have all been tried. 
<br>
<br>
Our only hope lies in a technologically enlightened future.
