<div class="TeaserText">From <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>'s revolutionary book <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">The Age of Intelligent Machines</a>, published in 1990.</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>For reasons that will be made clear, the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>" is not much used in the U.K. "IKBS" (intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-based systems) tends to be the term employed to cover work in expert systems, <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a>, and logic languages. There is a long <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the U.K., dating back to <a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a>'s pioneering work just before and after World War II. That strange <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> foresaw the use of stored-<a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> machines for much more than mathematical calculation, and in the early 1950s he enabled us to compare human and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> by postulating a test by which one could determine whether true artificial simulation of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> had been achieved. He proposed that an observer in one room should try to tell if he is conversing with a man or a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> in another room. And he also predicted that this test for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> would be achieved by the year 2000. Well, there are still some years to go, and it remains an open question whether his prediction will be proved right; most of his other predictions have been amply fulfilled. One might add that some people believe Colby's <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> PARRY has achieved <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, because it fooled psychiatrists into believing they were dealing with the output from paranoid human beings. If some people are not impressed with this, it may be because they are not impressed with psychiatrists.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/turing_entry.html">Alan Turing</a> worked in various places in the U.K., including the National Physical Laboratory, Bletchley Park, and the University of Manchester. After his time the center of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work shifted to the University of Edinburgh, where Donald Michie built up a considerable team and formed one of the first centers in the world for the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>. The university has produced excellent work in the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> field, though perhaps its most renowned output has been its students, who have gone on to populate <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> centers throughout the world. Donald Michie himself has moved on to found the Turing Institute at Strathclyde University, which provides an advisory and training service to industry. But the very broadly based team at Edinburgh, with groups ranging from <a class="thought" href="entries/linguistics_entry.html">linguistics</a> through logic programming to speech recognition and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>, still continues as perhaps the dominant center for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the U.K.</p>
<p>Another much smaller center for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the U.K. academic world is at Sussex University, where the POPLOG <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> environment is being developed under Professor Aaron Sloman. POPLOG contains compilers for <a class="thought" href="entries/prolog_entry.html">PROLOG</a> and Common <a class="thought" href="entries/lisp_entry.html">LISP</a> as well as one for POP, a simulation <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> that has its adherents in the U.K. community. After Edinburgh, perhaps the main centers for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work are at Imperial College, London and Cambridge. Bob Kowalski heads the team at Imperial, where work is in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> on logic programming, expert systems, and Declarative <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">Language</a> architectures. One of the interesting recent applications of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> techniques there has been to the construction of a rule base for the interpretation of legislation, the chosen example being the British Nationality Act, perhaps not one of the most logically constructed pieces of British legislation.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> work flourishes at many university centers. Imperial College and Manchester University are cooperating to produce a general-purpose parallel <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a>, and a development stage of this <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>, called Alice, has been installed at Imperial College and also at the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> center at Edinburgh University, where it is possible to make comparisons with various other machines. Other work in parallel architectures is in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at universities at Cambridge, Reading, Bath, Southampton, East Anglia, Glasgow, and St. Andrews as well as at University College and Queen Mary College, London.</p>
<p>Work in <a class="thought" href="entries/natural_language_entry.html">natural language</a> is relatively weak in the U.K., in comparison with the amount of work on logic programming and advanced architectures. But there is some work being done at Cambridge and the Open University, and as a part of speech recognition, work is in <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> at various centers, most notably at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Lighthill Study of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">Artificial Intelligence</a>, which was commissioned by the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Council toward the end of the 1950s, was a major setback for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the U.K. In this report Sir James Lighthill suggested that one needed a major breakthrough before it would be possible to gain much by tackling the subject of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> as a coherent whole. He recommended that robotic developments should be pursued in their own right, just as the study of human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> should be, but that it would not be very profitable, for the moment, to expect an understanding of the way the mind operated to lead to practical applications of so-called <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>. In a sense, time has supported his contention, for with the exception of low-level vision, there is little evidence that the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> practical applications have received much benefit from the study of how the human mind works. Interestingly, it would appear that the study of human behavior has benefited rather more from developments in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>It was probably not intended that the Lighthill report would result in a cutback in work on the <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a> parts of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> in the U.K., but this is generally said to have been the result. It probably also intensified the feeling in the U.K. that the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>" is unfortunate, with its implications that the products are a replacement or rival to human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a>. For this <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>, when work on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> was intensified in the early 1980s, the term "<a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-based systems" was employed, usually preceded by the word "intelligent" as a sop to the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community.</p>
<p>If the Lighthill Report of the early 1970s was paradise lost for the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community, the Alvey Report of the early 1980s was paradise regained. The Alvey Report was triggered by the Japanese announcement of their fifth-generation <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> at a conference in Tokyo in the autumn of 1981. In practice, this <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is not very large by Japanese standards. The Japanese <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> center, ICOT, still does not <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> more than 60 workers. But the fact that Japan announced this belief in the importance of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of the Japanese economy was enough to launch renewed support for <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. In the U.K. the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of interest in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, and indeed in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> generally, actually preceded the Japanese announcement.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> and Engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> Council (SERC), the body in the U.K. that has the responsibility for funding academic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> in the physical and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> sciences and in engineering, had already initiated a specially promoted <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> for <a class="thought" href="entries/distributed_computing_entry.html">distributed computing</a>, which led to much of the flowering of work in parallel computing and declarative and logic languages. A study of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">architecture</a> requirements for IKBS was initiated, and this in practice formed the background for the strategy for the IKBS or <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> part of the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>.</p>
<p>The Alvey Committee, which planned the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, saw it as a way of marshaling all the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> resources of the U.K. to an attack on what were then seen, and are still largely seen today, as the enabling or underlying technologies required to support the whole of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The committee's report, accepted by the <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> in May 1983, called for a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> costing 350 million pounds over 5 years, of which industry would pay for about half, or 150 million pounds. The <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> contribution of 200 million pounds would come from the Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defense, and the SERC.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> was seen as one of cooperative <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, and in practice the work is being carried out by some 200 project teams drawn from industry, the universities and polytechnics, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> institutions, which are largely <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a> establishments. Typically, teams from two or three firms and one or two universities take part in each project. Universities are involved in over 85 percent of the projects, and there is a special "uncle" project class for work of a long-range or speculative <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> in the universities supported by some company that takes an avuncular interest in the work. Altogether, the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> employs some 2,300 <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> workers and has probably doubled the effort in the fields covered. Sixteen clubs exist to bring together all the workers in a common field; for example, the Speech Club covers workers in the 10 projects in that field.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work largely falls into the IKBS and man-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> (MMI) parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, the other parts being <a class="thought" href="entries/vlsi_entry.html">VLSI</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> engineering. MMI covers human factors and speech and <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. There are also considerable developments in expert systems in the Large Demonstrator parts of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, which are designed to pull the work together into some practically orientated major projects. Overall, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work probably constitutes nearly half of the whole <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, appearing in all parts. For example, the <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-engineering <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> includes a set of integrated project-support environments, <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-project tool sets. The most advanced of these will be based on the use of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> techniques. But it is only fair to add that the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>-engineering communities in the U.K. are not really converging as fast as one might like to see.</p>
<p>Much of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work in the U.K. has suffered from a lack of suitable experts. So part of the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> is devoted to building up the skilled manpower. When the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>-trained postgraduate workers from the Alvey projects soon start becoming available for employment in the general community, this will make a very considerable impact on the available skilled manpower. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> has initiated a Journeyman scheme under which good people from industry with skills in <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> but lacking in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> expertise go to sit at the feet of masters in the academic centers for six months or so while working on projects of interest to their employers.</p>
<p>The Awareness part of the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> has proved to be a great success. The Alvey Tapes are a set of videotaped lectures of distinguished experts on <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> prepared for the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> by the Open University. The 16 one-hour tapes cover subjects like logic programming, dealing with uncertainty, image understanding, <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> learners, natural-<a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> processing, and various aspects of expert systems. One of the most popular tapes, designed to counter the oft repeated canard that expert systems are not really used, shows examples of such systems at work in British industry.</p>
<p>Another way of helping British industry to get started on building expert systems has been through the Expert Systems Starter Pack put together by the National Computing Centre. These consist of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> tapes for four different expert-<a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> design tools, together with training guides. These tools provide elementary <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> of such techniques as backward- and forward-chaining inference mechanisms and the use of dialog generators.</p>
<p>To spread the <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of expert systems widely in British industry and commerce, a set of Community Clubs has been established. A Community Club typically consists of 10 to 30 likeminded firms who join together to study the development of an <a class="thought" href="entries/expert_system_entry.html">expert system</a> in an area of particular interest to them. They work with a team from the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry or the universities that has had <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> in building expert systems, and together they draw up a specification, recruit staff to build the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, construct the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>, and then test it. Often one or more of the firms acts as the guinea pig for trying out the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>. The Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> has sponsored nine such</p>
<p>Community Clubs in fields like financial services (Small Company Health Adviser), insurance, data processing (Help Disk Adviser for data-processing installations), econometric modeling, planning for real-time manufacturing projects, quantity surveying, real-time quality control of processing plants, transport-route planning, and water-industry construction planning. Altogether, some 200 organizations are participating in these clubs and <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to build and use expert systems for a purely nominal fee. They have greatly helped to spread awareness of the power and limitations of expert systems in the U.K. The initiative is being copied by others, so that <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> about expert systems has grown very fast in the U.K. It is not accidental that the expert-systems group of the British <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">Society</a> is perhaps the most flourishing such <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> in the U.K. today. It is probably true to say that there is more true awareness of the implications of expert systems in the U.K. than elsewhere, even if the magnitude of some of the applications in the U.S. is far larger.</p>
<p>No picture of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> scene in the U.K. today would be complete without mention of the part played by the EEC's ESPRIT <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. ESPRIT is a <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> very like the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> except that the cooperative teams are drawn from throughout the European Community of 12 nations. In scale it is, for the U.K., about half the size of the Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, which means that in total for Europe it consists of about twice the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of workers. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is about a fifth of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, being largely represented in the Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">Information</a> Processing part of the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Of course, ESPRIT has the crucial role of bringing the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> workers of Europe together. Perhaps for the first time the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community in the U.K. is coming into active contact with the other <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> workers in Europe not just to carry out project work but also to plan, evaluate, and <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. And in several countries in Europe there are also nationally sponsored programs, so the total <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> effort in Europe is far from negligible and its historic problem of fragmentation is being overcome.</p>
<p>Looking to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>, a committee in the UK is now planning an After Alvey <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>, and the second phase of ESPRIT is also under discussion. Though one cannot be certain at this stage just what will emerge, it seems very probable that some planned and coordinated programs will continue, perhaps with a rather larger bias toward actual applications than the precompetitive <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> programs of the first wave. What is certain is that the buildup of interest and work in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> in Europe will continue. The overall scene in the U.K. and Europe can be characterized by saying that there is now immense awareness of the potential to be unlocked by applying the techniques developed under the banner of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> work. Though much of the work is at a rather elementary stage, characterized by a shortage of expert workers, there are nevertheless some true centers of expertise to rank with the best in the United States in terms of quantity. The recognition that yet to come are the true breakthroughs, both in understanding and in application, spurs on the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> community in Europe. And the cooperative programs of the last few years have served to build up significant, multidisciplinary teams that bid to make a real impact on the world <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> scene. The Europeans who have led and inspired many of the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> developments of the last forty years will be followed up by a growing army of experts. These experts recognize that <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> is going to make a great impact on the world in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> but that the breakthroughs that will be needed will demand considerable teams drawn from a very wide range of disciplines.</p>
