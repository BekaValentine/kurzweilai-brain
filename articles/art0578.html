<p><i>Originally published by Henry Holt and Company 1999. Published on KurzweilAI.net May 15, 2003.</i></p>
<p> To a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> that seeks to communicate, offering instantaneous 
              global connectivity is like wiring the pleasure center of a rat's 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> to a bar that the rat then presses over and over until it 
              drops from exhaustion. I hit bottom when I found myself in Corsica, 
              at the beach, in a pay phone booth, connecting my laptop with an 
              acoustic modem coupler to take care of some perfectly mundane e-mail. 
              That's when I threw away my pager that delivered e-mail to me as 
              I traveled, disconnected my <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> phone that let my laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> 
              e-mail anywhere, and began answering e&#173;mail just once a day. These 
              technologies were like the rat's pleasure bar, just capable enough 
              to provide instant <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> gratification, but not intelligent 
              enough to help me manage that <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Revolution has promised a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of boundless opportunity 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a>ed at the speed of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, of a globally <a class="thought" href="entries/wired_entry.html">wired</a> world, of unlimited 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/entertainment_entry.html">entertainment</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a> within everyone's reach. The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is something less than that.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">World Wide Web</a> touches the rather limited subset of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              spent sitting alone staring at a screen. The way we browse the Web, 
              clicking with a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>, is like what a child does sitting in a shopping 
              cart at a supermarket, pointing at things of interest, perpetually 
              straining to reach treats that are just out of reach. Children at 
              play present a much more compelling metaphor for interacting with 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>, using all of their senses to explore and create, in 
              groups as well as alone. Anyone who was ever a child understands 
              these skills, but <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s don't.</p>
<p>The march of technical <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> threatens to turn the simple pleasure 
              of reading a nicely bound book, or writing with a fountain pen, 
              into an antitechnical act of defiance. To keep up, your book should 
              be on a <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a>, and your writing should be done with a stylus on 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>'s input tablet. But the <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> is that books or fountain 
              pens really do perform their intended jobs better than their <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              descendants.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean we should throw out our <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s; it means we 
              should expect much more from them. As radical as it may sound, it 
              actually is increasingly possible to ask that new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> work 
              as well as what it presumes to replace. We've only recently been 
              able to explain why the printing on a sheet of paper looks so much 
              better than the same text on a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> screen, and are just beginning 
              to glimpse how we can use <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> inks to turn paper itself into 
              a display so that the <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a>s of a book can change.</p>
<p>Unless this challenge is taken seriously, the connected <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              world will remain full of barriers. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> with a keyboard and 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a> can be used by only one person at a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, helping you communicate 
              with someone on the other side of the world but not with someone 
              in the same room. Inexpensive <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s still cost as much as a 
              used car, and are much more difficult to understand how to operate, 
              dividing <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> into an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-rich upper class and an <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>-poor 
              underclass. A compact disc player faithfully reproduces the artistic 
              creations of a very small group of people and turns everyone else 
              into passive consumers. We live in a three-dimensional world, but 
              displays and <a class="thought" href="entries/printer_entry.html">printer</a>s restrict <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to two-dimensional surfaces. 
              A desktop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> requires a desk, and a laptop <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> requires 
              a lap, forcing you to sit still. Either you can take a walk, or 
              you can use a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>.</p>
<p>These problems can all be fixed by dismantling the real barrier, 
              the one between <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> and our physical world. We're 
              made out of atoms, and will continue to be for the foreseeable <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. 
              All of the bits in the world are of no use unless they can meet 
              us out here on our terms. The very notion that <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s can create 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/virtual_reality_entry.html">virtual reality</a> requires an awkward linguistic construction to 
              refer to "real" <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>, what's left outside the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>. That's 
              backward. Rather than replace our world, we should first look to 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s to enhance it.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Revolution is an incomplete story. There is a disconnect 
              between the breathless pronouncements of cyber gurus and the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> 
              of ordinary people left perpetually upgrading <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> to meet the 
              demands of new <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a>, or wondering where their files have gone, 
              or trying to understand why they can't connect to the <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>. The 
              revolution so far has been for the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s, not the people.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> of all kinds, whether an e-mail message or a movie, 
              is encoded as a string of 0's and 1's because of a remarkable discovery 
              by Claude Shannon and John von Neumann in the 1940s. Prior to their 
              work, it was obvious that <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ered <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s degraded with <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              and use. A tape recording sounds worse after it is duplicated, a 
              photocopy is less satisfactory than an original, a telephone call 
              becomes more garbled the farther it has to travel. They showed that 
              this is not so for a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation. Errors still occur 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s, but instead of continuously degrading the performance 
              there is a threshold below which errors can be corrected with near 
              certainty. This means that you can send a message to the next room, 
              or to the next <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>, and be confident that it will arrive in the 
              form in which you sent it. In fact, our understanding of how to 
              correct errors has improved so quickly over <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that it has enabled 
              deep-<a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> probes to continue sending <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> at the same rate even 
              though their signals have been growing steadily weaker.</p>
<p>The same <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a> argument applies to manipulating 
              and storing <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a>. A <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> can be made out of imperfect 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s yet faithfully execute a sequence of instructions for 
              as long as is needed. <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">Data</a> can be saved to a medium that is sure 
              to degrade, but be kept in perpetuity as long as it is periodically 
              copied with <a class="thought" href="entries/error_correction_entry.html">error correction</a>. Although no one knows how long a single 
              CD will last, our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> can leave a permanent legacy that will 
              outlast any stone tablet as long as someone or something is around 
              to do a <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> of regular housekeeping.</p>
<p>In the 1980s at centers such as MIT's <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, people realized 
              that the implications of a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> representation go far beyond 
              reliability: <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> can transcend its physical representation. 
              At the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> ruinous battles were being fought over formats for <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> such as videotapes (<a class="thought" href="entries/sony_entry.html">Sony</a>'s Betamax vs. Matsushita's VHS) and 
              high-definition television (the United States vs. Europe vs. Japan). 
              These were <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a> formats, embodied in the custom <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>ry needed 
              to decode them. Because <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> sales were tied to the format, 
              control over the standards was seen as the path to economic salvation.</p>
<p>These heated arguments missed the simple observation that a stream 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> could equally well represent a video, or some text, 
              or a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>. Rather than decide in advance which format 
              to use, <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> can be sent with the instructions for a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to 
              decode them so that anyone is free to define a new standard without 
              needing new <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a>. The consumers who were supposed to be buying 
              high-definition television sets from the national champions are 
              instead buying PCs to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> the Web.</p>
<p>The protocols of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> now serve to eliminate rather than 
              enforce divisions among types of <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>s can be connected 
              without regard to who made them or where they are, and <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              can be connected without needing to artificially separate sights 
              and sounds, <a class="thought" href="entries/content_entry.html">content</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a>. The one minor remaining incompatibility 
              is with people.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars are spent developing powerful processors that 
              are put into dumb boxes that have changed little from the earliest 
              days of computing. Yet for so many people and so many applications, 
              the limitation is the box, not the processor. Most <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are 
              nearly blind, deaf, and dumb. These inert <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s channel the richness 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> through a keyboard and a <a class="thought" href="entries/mouse_entry.html">mouse</a>. The speed 
              of the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> is increasingly much less of a concern than the 
              difficulty in telling it what you want it to do, or in understanding 
              what it has done, or in using it where you want to go rather than 
              where it can go.</p>
<p>More <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s are being put on a <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a>, more lines of <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> are 
              being added to <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s, more <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are appearing on the desks 
              in an office, but <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s are not getting easier to use and workers 
              are not becoming more productive. An army of <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ers is continuing 
              to solve these legacy problems from the early days of computing, 
              when what's needed is better integration between <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and the 
              rest of the world.</p>
<p>The essential division in the industry between <a class="thought" href="entries/hardware_entry.html">hardware</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> 
              represents the organization of computing from the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> designer's 
              point of view, not the user's. In successful mature technologies 
              it's not possible to isolate the form and the function. The logical 
              design and the mechanical design of a pen or a piano bind their 
              mechanism with their user <a class="thought" href="entries/interface_entry.html">interface</a> so closely that it's possible 
              to use them without <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> of them as <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, or even <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a> 
              of them at all.</p>
<p>Invisibility is the missing goal in computing. <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information technology</a> 
              is at an awkward developmental stage where it is adept at communicating 
              its needs and those of other people, but not yet able to anticipate 
              yours. From here we can either unplug everything and go back to 
              an <a class="thought" href="entries/agrarian_entry.html">agrarian</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>&amp;#8212an intriguing but unrealistic option&#8212;or 
              we can bring so much <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> so close to people that it can finally 
              disappear. Beyond seeking to make <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s ubiquitous, we should 
              try to make them unobtrusive.</p>
<p>A VCR insistently flashing 12:00 is annoying, but notice that it 
              doesn't know that it is a VCR, that the job of a VCR is to tell 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> rather than ask it, that there are atomic clocks available 
              on the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> that can give it the exact <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, or even that you 
              might have left the room and have no interest in what it thinks 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> is. As we increasingly cohabit with <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s, we are doomed 
              to be frustrated by our creations if they lack the rudimentary abilities 
              we take for granted&#8212;having an <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a>, knowing something about 
              our environment, and being able to communicate. In return, these 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s need to be designed with the presumption that it is their 
              job to do what we want, not the converse. Like my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, my children 
              started <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> by insisting that I provide their inputs and collect 
              their outputs, but unlike my <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> they are now <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how 
              to do these things for themselves.</p>
<p>Fixing the division of labor between people and <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s depends 
              on understanding what each does best. One day I came into my lab 
              and found all my students clustered around a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a>. From the looks 
              on their faces I could tell that this was one of those times when 
              the world had changed. This was when it had just become possible 
              to add a camera and microphone to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> and see similarly equipped 
              people elsewhere. There was a reverential awe as live faces would 
              pop up on the screen. An early <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> cartoon showed two dogs 
              typing at a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>, one commenting to the other that the great 
              thing about the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> was that no one could tell that they were 
              dogs. Now we could.</p>
<p>And the dogs were right. The next day the <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> was turned off, 
              and it hasn't been used since. The ghostly faces on the screen couldn't 
              compete with the resolution, refresh rate, three-dimensionality, 
              color fidelity, and relevance of the people outside of the screen. 
              My students found that the people around them were generally much 
              more interesting than the ones on the screen.</p>
<p>It's no accident that one of the first Web celebrities was a thing, 
              not a person. A camera trained on the coffeepot in the <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">Computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> department at Cambridge University was connected to a Web 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> that could show you the state of the coffeepot, timely <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              of great value (if you happen to be in the department and want a 
              cup of coffee).</p>
<p>Even better would be for the coffee <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> to check when you want 
              coffee, rather than the other way around. If your coffee cup could 
              measure the temperature and volume of your coffee, and relay that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> to a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> that kept track of how much coffee you 
              drank at what times, it could do a pretty good job of guessing when 
              you would be coming by for a refill. This does not require sticking 
              a <a class="thought" href="entries/personal_computer_entry.html">PC</a> into the cup; it is possible to embed simple materials in it 
              that can be sensed from a distance. The <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> handling is also simple; 
              a lifetime record of coffee drinking is dwarfed by the amount of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> in a few moments of video. And it does not require a breakthrough 
              in <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> to predict coffee consumption.</p>
<p>A grad student in the <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">Media</a> Lab, Joseph Kaye, <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ed our 
              coffee <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> and found the unsurprising result that there's a 
              big peak in consumption in the morning after people get in, and 
              another one in the afternoon after lunch. He went further to add 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> tags so that the coffee <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> could recognize <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> 
              coffee cups and thereby give you the kind of coffee you prefer, 
              along with relevant news retrieved from a <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> while you wait. 
              No one of these steps is revolutionary, but taken together their 
              implications are. You get what you want&amp;#8212a fresh cup of coffee&#8212;without 
              having to attend to the details. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s are communicating 
              with each other so that you don't have to.</p>
<p>For all of the coverage of the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of the <a class="thought" href="entries/internet_entry.html">Internet</a> and the World 
              Wide Web, a far bigger change is coming as the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of things 
              using the Net dwarfs the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of people. The real promise of connecting 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s is to free people, by embedding the means to solve problems 
              in the things around us.</p>
<p>There's some precedent for this kind of organization. The recurring 
              lesson we've learned from the study of <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> is that hard problems 
              are solved by the interaction of many simple <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a> is 
              very much a bottom-up design that gets updated without a lot of 
              central planning. This does not mean that <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is steady. Far 
              from it; just ask a dinosaur (or a <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a>). Here we come to the 
              real problem with the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">Digital</a> Revolution. Revolutions break things. 
              Sometimes that's a necessary thing to do, but continuously discarding 
              the old and heralding the new is not a sustainable way to live.</p>
<p>Very few mature technologies become obsolete. Contrary to predictions, 
              radio did not kill off newspapers, because it's not possible to 
              skim through a radio <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> and flip back and forth to parts of 
              interest. Television similarly has not eliminated radio, because 
              there are plenty of times when our ears are more available than 
              our eyes. <a class="thought" href="entries/cdrom_entry.html">CD-ROM</a>s have made little dent in book publishing because 
              of the many virtues of a printed book. Far more interesting than 
              declaring a revolution is to ask how to capture the essence of what 
              works well in the present in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to improve the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>.</p>
<p>The real challenge is to figure out how to create <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s with 
              many <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>s that can work together and change. We've had a <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> 
              revolution; we now need <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a>. That's what this book 
              is about: what happens when the <a class="thought" href="entries/digital_entry.html">digital</a> world merges with the physical 
              world, why we've come to the current state-of-the-<a class="thought" href="entries/art_entry.html">art</a> (and state-of-the-artless), 
              and how to free bits from the confines of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s. The <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s 
              have had their turn; now it's ours.</p>
