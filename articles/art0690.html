<div class="TeaserText">A new book, The Intelligent Universe, proposes that the universe might end in intelligent life, one that has acquired the capacity to shape the cosmos as a whole. </div>
<br>
<br> <p><em>To be published in </em>The Intelligent <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">Universe</a><em>, New Page 
              Books, February 2007. Published on KurzweilAI.net Feb. 2, 2007.</em></p>
<p>There is a <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> clearly visible right outside your front  door. It's easy to see--in fact, it's impossible to overlook--although its  awesome powers are generally ignored by all but a discerning few. The unearthly  <a class="thought" href="entries/beauty_entry.html">beauty</a>, the ineffable grandeur, and the ingenuity of construction of this time  machine are humbling to every <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> being who makes an effort to probe into the  enigma of its origin and the mystery of its ultimate destiny. The time machine  of which I speak is emphatically not of human origin. Indeed, a few venturesome  scientists are beginning to entertain a truly incredible possibility: that this  <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> is an <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a> bequeathed to us by a supreme <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that existed  long, long ago and far, far away. All <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>able observers agree that the  scope of its stupendous powers and the sheer delicacy of its miniscule moving  parts seem nothing short of miraculous. </p>
<p>A second amazing but incontrovertible fact confronts those trained  in the <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/cosmology_entry.html">cosmology</a>: We human beings are living our daily lives in the  midst of <a class="thought" href="entries/extraterrestrial_entry.html">extraterrestrial</a> entities. These entities are everywhere--in the air we  breathe, in the food we eat, in the ground beneath our feet, and inside our  bodies. These extraterrestrials have made an incredible journey from the venue  of their birth to reach <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/earth_entry.html">Earth</a>. Their epic migration, spanning millions  of <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>-years, dwarfs the fictional interstellar voyages of the starship <em>Enterprise</em>. They are the  real <a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">star trek</a>kers, with more mileage on their odometers than we are capable of  imagining. And perhaps most astonishing, we could not possibly survive without  their constant presence, and the unfailing exercise of their special powers.</p>
<p>Could the <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a> of this purported time machine be anything but  outrageous <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a>? And how could there be extraterrestrials among us  that we have never noticed? Surely not even an inebriated television producer  would find these ideas sufficiently credible to weave into an <em>X-Files</em> plot! </p>
<p>Yet I can assure you that both propositions are correct. Indeed,  they are indisputable. </p>
<p>The time machine is the universe itself. We see its local features  every night in the starry sky above us. The firmament we observe is not a  picture of the stars and galaxies as they exist today, but rather a kind of  cinematic image of our corner of the cosmos as it existed years ago--in the case  of the great <a class="thought" href="entries/galaxy_entry.html">galaxy</a> Andromeda, millions of years ago. Because starlight travels  through the immensity of interstellar and intergalactic <a class="thought" href="entries/space_entry.html">space</a> at a finite pace,  and because of the inconceivable vastness of the cosmos, we look backward in  time with every glance at the nighttime sky. </p>
<p>With powerful spectacles to aid our vision--massive <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s  such as the telescopes that dot the peak of Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the Hubble  Space Telescope--we can extend our gaze incredibly far back into the past,  indeed virtually to the moment of the Big Bang. And with even more  sophisticated observational instruments, such as the Advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/laser_entry.html">Laser</a>  Interferometer Gravitational- <a class="thought" href="entries/wave_entry.html">Wave</a> Observatory (LIGO) and the space-based Big  Bang Observer (BBO) that <a class="thought" href="entries/nasa_entry.html">NASA</a> hopes to deploy by 2025, there is hope that we  will be able to glimpse the moment of cosmic creation itself--the very genesis  of space and time.</p>
<p>What about those extraterrestrials? They are the atoms that  combine to form the <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s from which our bodies and virtually everything  else in our world and the <a class="thought" href="entries/solar_system_entry.html">solar system</a> are made. These extraterrestrials were  not, for the most part, born <em>ex nihilo</em> in the fireball of the Big Bang.  Instead, they were hammered into existence in the forges of supernova  explosions--rare conflagrations that release more <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> in a <a class="thought" href="#">flash</a> than the  normal output of the billions of ordinary stars in a typical galaxy. </p>
<p>Of all these extraterrestrial entities, the one with the most  unusual birth story is <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a>, the essential foundation of <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a> as we know it.  The peculiar process of stellar alchemy by which <a class="thought" href="entries/element_entry.html">element</a>al carbon is coaxed  into existence is so delicate and improbable that it prompted a giant of  British <a class="thought" href="entries/astronomy_entry.html">astronomy</a>, Sir Fred Hoyle, to utter the most famous and controversial  remark of his storied career:</p>
<p><em>Would  you not say to yourself, "Some super-calculating intellect must have designed  the properties of the carbon <a class="thought" href="entries/atom_entry.html">atom</a>, otherwise the  chance of my finding such an atom through the blind forces of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> would be  utterly minuscule?" Of course you would.... A <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> interpretation of  the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a>, as well as  with <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a>, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking  about in nature. The <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>s one calculates from the facts seem to me so  overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.</em><sup><a name="cit1"></a><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Hoyle's remark is the inspiration for <em>The Intelligent Universe</em>.  The book is the story of an idea, and the idea is quite simple: The best way to  think about life, intelligence, and the universe is that they are not separate  things, but are different aspects of a single <a class="thought" href="entries/phenomenon_entry.html">phenomenon</a>. To take liberties  with a popular ballad, "We are the world, we are the people, <em>and</em> we are the  universe." To state this proposition from the opposite perspective, the  universe is coming to life and waking up through the processes of our lives and  <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>s, and, very probably, through the lives and thoughts of countless other  beings scattered throughout the cosmos. </p>
<p>One startling implication of this idea is that the <em>true</em> story of  the origin of the human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> is longer than the saga of terrestrial  <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> conceived of by <a class="thought" href="entries/darwin_entry.html">Charles Darwin</a> and his intellectual progeny. Thanks  to the discoveries of Hoyle and other cosmologists, it is now beyond dispute  that the life <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of humanity includes the entire history of the cosmos  itself. Why? Because an inconceivably ancient and immense universe is needed to  create even one species of minuscule living creatures on a single planet  orbiting a nondescript <a class="thought" href="entries/star_entry.html">star</a> in the outer reaches of an ordinary galaxy. </p>
<p>If the cosmos were not so old and large, multiple generations of  stars could not have formed, burned brightly for billions of years, and then  blown themselves to pieces in titanic supernovae explosions, thereby  synthesizing all the higher elements in the periodic table. Absent those  elements (especially carbon and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a>), there could be no life anywhere amid  the countless galaxies that fill the universe. </p>
<p>A second implication of this <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> is that if extraterrestrial  life and intelligence should exist, it will inevitably be related to mankind.  No, I am not talking about a <a class="thought" href="entries/government_entry.html">government</a>-suppressed history of alien visitation  and cross-breeding, or even the slightly more plausible scenario outlined by  Nobel laureate <a class="thought" href="entries/crick_entry.html">Francis Crick</a> of <em>directed panspermia</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Directed  Panspermia</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature</em><a href="#foot2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="cit2"></a>  Nobel laureate Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the double helix <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> of  <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>, put forward a <a class="thought" href="entries/hypothesis_entry.html">hypothesis</a> about the origin of life on Earth that many of  his scientific colleagues viewed as outlandish, even scandalous. The essence of  Crick's scenario was that, contrary to Darwin's  speculation that the first living things may have emerged spontaneously in a  warm little pond, terrestrial life was deliberately seeded by an advanced alien  race billions of years ago. Crick's ideas built on those of Swedish physicist Svante  August Arrhenius, who suggested in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century that life did not get  started on Earth, but was seeded by microorganisms drifting in from outer space  under the gentle pressure of ambient starlight.</p>
<p>A perceived weakness of Arrhenius's theory--called simply <em>panspermia</em>,  which translates literally as <em>seeds</em> <em>everywhere</em>--was  that it was thought unlikely that spores or microorganisms could survive the  harsh radiation of space for the decades, centuries, or even millennia that  would be required for <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> to slowly waft from even the nearest stars to  our solar system.</p>
<p>Crick sought to remedy this weakness in Arrhenius's theory by  proposing that the transplanted extraterrestrial<strong> </strong>microorganisms  had actually traveled to Earth within the protective hull of an alien  spaceship! As Crick put it: </p>
<p><em>Life started here when these <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s were dropped  into the primitive ocean and began to multiply.</em><a href="#foot3"><sup>3</sup></a><a name="cit3"></a> </p>
<p>Why would this obviously serious-minded and gifted scientist put  forward such a seemingly eccentric proposal? Essentially, Crick was attempting  to take seriously the logical implications of what he recognized as "the very  high degree of [the] <em>organized <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> </em>[of  living things] we find at every level, and especially at the molecular level."<sup><a href="#foot4">4</a></sup><a name="cit4"></a>  In <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> for even the simplest living creature to metabolize and reproduce, a vast  array of incredibly complicated and interdependent molecular machinery must  function, at a nanoscale level, with a degree of flawless precision that makes  the <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>s of a Boeing 747 look downright primitive by comparison. As Crick put  it in a candid and colorful remark that has become a key talking point for the  Intelligent Design crowd: </p>
<p><em>The origin of life appears at the moment to be almost  a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been  satisfied to get it going.</em><a href="#foot5"><sup>5</sup></a><a name="cit5"></a></p>
<p>But if life originated on an alien world and was later transported  here by a race of intelligent aliens, then the probabilistic resources  available to explain a random origin of life's organized complexity can be  expanded exponentially. The major conceptual weakness of Crick's directed  panspermia scenario is that it merely postpones the ultimate question: How did  life originally get going, either on a distant planet or in that proverbial  warm little pond right here on Earth?</p>
<hr>
<p>I am asserting that wherever and however life and intelligence may  exist elsewhere in the cosmos, it will have originated and evolved from a  universally shared <a class="thought" href="entries/substrate_entry.html">substrate</a>: the chemical elements of the periodic table and  the <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> forces and <a class="thought" href="entries/parameter_entry.html">parameter</a>s of physics. As far as anyone can tell, these  elements, forces, and parameters appear invariant throughout the visible  universe. They can be thought of as a kind of "deep DNA"--a universal genetic  <a class="thought" href="entries/code_entry.html">code</a> inscribed far below the level of terrestrial <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>s. At this fundamental  level, everyone and everything that exists in the universe, whether animate or  inanimate, is intimately related. And because all of this living and  not-yet-living stuff owes its ultimate origin to a common genesis <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a> (the  Big Bang), we are all related in a family way. With apologies to Saint Francis  of Assisi, we  can confidently state that Earth's satellite truly is Sister Moon, and that the  life-giving star 93 million miles away is genuinely Brother Sun. </p>
<p>A third implication of the concept is that because the vast  preponderance of the lifetime of the universe lies in the distant <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> rather  than in the past, the historical achievements of life and <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> are meager  foreshadowings of the starring role that intelligent life is likely to play in  shaping the future of the cosmos. Indeed, this new way of looking at the  intimate linkage of life, mind, and the cosmos suggests a <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> way of <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>  about the ultimate destiny of our universe. </p>
<p>Traditionally, scientists have offered two bleak answers to the  profound issue of how the universe will end: <em>fire</em> or <em>ice</em>. The cosmos might end  in<em> fire</em>--a cataclysmic <a class="thought" href="entries/big_crunch_entry.html">Big Crunch</a> in which galaxies, planets, and any life forms  that might have endured to the end time are consumed in a raging inferno as the  universe contracts in a kind of Big Bang, but in reverse. </p>
<p>Or the universe might end in <em>ice</em>--a ceaseless expansion of the  fabric of spacetime in which the thin soup of <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> and energy is eternally  diluted and cooled. Under this scenario, stars wither and die, constellations  of cold matter recede further and further from one another, and the vast  project of cosmic evolution simply fades into quiet and endless oblivion.</p>
<p><em>The Intelligent Universe</em> proposes a third possibility: that the  universe might end in <em>intelligent life</em>. Not life as we know it, but life that  has acquired the <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> to shape the cosmos as a whole, just as life on Earth  has acquired the ability to shape the land, the sea, and the atmosphere. As Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson puts it: </p>
<p><em>Mind, through  the long course of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> evolution, has established itself as a moving  force in our little corner of the universe. Here on this small planet, mind has  infiltrated matter and has taken control. It appears to me that the tendency of  mind to infiltrate and control matter is a law of nature.</em><sup><a href="#foot6">6</a></sup><a name="cit6"></a></p>
<p>My first book, <em>Biocosm</em>,<sup><a href="#foot7">7</a><a name="cit7"></a></sup> was  one long argument that the cosmos possesses a <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a> function (some value or  outcome that is being maximized) and that the specific utility function of our  cosmos is propagation of baby universes exhibiting the same life-friendly  physical qualities as their parent-universe. Under this scenario, the mission  of sufficiently evolved intelligent life in the universe is essentially to serve  as a cosmic reproductive organ, spawning an endless succession of life-friendly  offspring that are themselves endowed with the same reproductive capacities as their  predecessors. The fact that our universe seems queerly hospitable to  carbonbased intelligent life--an astronomically improbable oddity that many  leading scientists have identified as the deepest mystery in all of  science--emerges in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of this hypothesis as a predictable outcome (a  <em>falsifiable retrodiction</em>, in the jargon of science).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Falsifiable  Retrodictions</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, scientists insist that new hypotheses generate  falsifiable <em>predictions </em>of <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al results in order to qualify as  genuine science. However, there are some fields of science--especially  archaeology and cosmology, which involve events that occurred in the distant  past or in physically inaccessible regions--that cannot generate predictions susceptible  to laboratory testing. Although a few purists regard these fields as  intrinsically unscientific, most scientists concede that it is appropriate for  so-called "historical" sciences, such as geology, evolutionary biology,  cosmology, paleontology, and archaeology to rely on retrodiction as an  alternate means of testing a scientific hypothesis. A retrodiction essentially compares  previously gathered observational evidence (for <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, the fossil record, in  the case of evolutionary biology) with the implications of a scientific  hypothesis (such as Darwinian natural selection). If the observational evidence  agrees with the implications of the hypothesis, the hypothesis is said to  retrodict the evidence. A detailed discussion of retrodiction as a tool for  testing scientific hypothesis is contained in Appendix A.</p>
<hr>
<p>Though <em>The Intelligent Universe</em> reprises some of the key themes of  <em>Biocosm</em>, its primary <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive is different. Unlike <em>Biocosm</em>, the purpose of  this book is not to lay out a scientific hypothesis but rather to tell an  extraordinary story--the story of the probable future of the universe. In  telling this story, I am going to introduce you to some very unusual and  interesting people. </p>
<p>You will meet a senior NASA official whose passion is  investigating the probable impact on <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> of the discovery of  extraterrestrial intelligence. You will encounter a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> scientist who is  coaxing <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to undergo a special kind of Darwinian evolution, thus  becoming more adept and financially valuable over time. And you will meet a  <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> prophet who, in my view, is the true contemporary heir to Darwin's intellectual  legacy. </p>
<p>You will also meet a fascinating cast of nonhuman players likely  to have leading roles on tomorrow's cosmic stage. They include: (1) super-smart  machines capable of out-thinking humans without breaking a sweat; (2) speedy  and cost-efficient interstellar probes that will consist of nothing more  substantial than elaborate software <a class="thought" href="entries/algorithm_entry.html">algorithm</a>s capable of "living" in the  innards of alien computers they may encounter on far-off planets; and (3)  intelligent extraterrestrials, which <a class="thought" href="entries/seti_entry.html">SETI</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers have not yet discovered  but whose probable existence is strongly predicted by my <em>Biocosm</em> hypothesis. </p>
<p><em>The Intelligent Universe</em>, then, is a kind of projected  travelogue--an imagined future history--of the cosmic journey that lies ahead.  The foundation for that projection is a vision of the deep linkage between the  three ostensibly separate phenomena previously mentioned: the appearance of  life, the emergence of intelligence, and the seemingly mindless physical  evolution of the cosmos. In discussing these topics, the book will not only  provide news dispatches from the frontiers of cosmological science, but also  offer musings about the philosophical implications of emerging scientific  insights for our self-image as a species. </p>
<p>Some skeptics and traditionalists will doubtless protest that such  philosophizing is out of place in a book that seeks to chronicle the latest  scientific thinking about the nature of the universe. In rebuttal, I offer the  timeless words of <a class="thought" href="entries/galileo_entry.html">Galileo</a>: </p>
<p><em><a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">Philosophy</a> is written in this grand book--I mean the universe--which  stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless  one first learns to comprehend the <a class="thought" href="entries/language_entry.html">language</a> and read the characters in which it  is written. </em></p>
<p>In the <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> of Galileo, I invite you to gaze into this grand  book--I mean our cosmos--and begin to learn the language and the characters in  which it is written. As we shall see, the grand book is not only a tale of the  past, but also a story about our tomorrows. Above all, it is a book that,  carefully deciphered, foretells the incredible journey that intelligent life  will make across the vast expanse of the cosmic future and the projected  consummation of that voyage--the emergence of the biocosm.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p> Certainly a visionary effort. But if intelligence is so interlined as to include the universe, then certainly consciousness would emerge as equally universal. Many years ago, I wrote a science magazine and proposed that we are the universe becoming aware of itself. The next month I saw an editorial by the editor of the magazine posting his discovery that we are the universe becoming aware of itself. I've seen that many times since, and I've gotten no credit.
<br>
<br>
 Genetic algoprithms of replication are built on a tautology. "Since I must replicate myself in order to survive, I will replicate myself in order to survive". That becomes the meaning, drive, and force of the replicative algorithm. It has been the driving force of empires, religions, and governments.
<br>
<br>
 The tautology is interrupted and the replicating drive is broken when the gene encounters difference, that bit of information that forces it to alter its reproductive strategy and adapt to different context. Scinetists are now speculating on a theory I was studying over 25 years ago, that the gene pool tends to resist change, leading to religious strategies to proselytize in order to maintain that resistance to change, but the original bit of information that altered the replicative algorithm was the virus. The virus, in its simple tautological process, caused an increase in intelligence within the gene pool. It did this in two basic fashions:
<br>
1. Entering the cells, it began to reproduce itself until it reached a threshold in which it challenged the integrity of the organism.
<br>
2. The organism usually began a "purge", cleansing itself of all possible external invaders. Failing this, it sent out antibodies to identify the virus and create interceptor cells to isolate it.
<br>
<br>
 The result of these two functions actually improved the gene's chances, its intelligence, and its adaptive capabilities. The organism, having identified and registering the virus' identity in its "library", now had a greater range of defenses against the external environment. The organism's "knowledge" base was larger. The virus itself had become part of the cellular reproductive process, altering that process so that it became adaptive to the external environment.
<br>
<br>
 Historians have long written that war creates evolutionary shortcuts that enhance our tenchology, intelligence, and awareness. It is likely that this came from those early viral invaders triggering all out response from organisms in the beginning.
<br>
<br>
 So it is that consciousness develops as we attack enemies, but we first must recognize them as different. After we win(or lose) we absorb( or are absorbed by)the losers, who then affect our own culture in different ways. This creates diversity within the conquering system and provides for adaptation and speciation.
<br>
<br>
 Or as the biblical book of James 4 says, war comes "from your lusts, that war in your members". A very apt description considering the above. War drives us to acknowledge difference and find reconciliation for that difference. the difference itself provides adaptive responses for our cultures.
<br>
<br>
 From genes to cultures, its all part of one universal force, extending to the universe.</p></td>

<br>
<br>
The blogger who wrote this could be my echo:
<br>
<br>
Many years ago (early 1960s) I wrote and proposed that the universe is becoming aware of itself in and through the body of mankind. Those were my words, almost exactly.
<br>
<br>
Many years ago, Carl Sagan wrote, "We are a way of the universe knowing itself."
<br>
<br>
So, on the brink of 2008, here we are knowing ourselves, knowing that we have thought the same goose-bumpy thought but did not know that each of us had thought the same thought. And now we do. 
<br>
<br>
And since I know that this was the universe producing this thought in me (this body) in the 1960s, in 2008 I now resonate with the others of you who are also "sense organs" in the "body" of the universe....

I keep hearing about how improbable the physical constants are, perfectly set for life ... could it be instead that almost any odd random set of conditions (or at least many sets of conditions) are sufficient for this same kind of self organization to build complexity out of those initial conditions.  In that Universe, the resulting creatures would be sure that the resulting network of parameters etc are just so improbably for the support of *their* kind of life, that they believe it must have been designed?
<br>
<br>
The workings of our cells are so improbably intricate that you can hardly blame the intelligent design crowd for being mesmerized by it ... yet with evolution and a touch of deeper and less understood laws of self organization, one can at least see that it's probable that it did spontaneously happen.  I'm not so sure that the Universe is different.</p></td>

 Yes, the beginnings of life as we know it would have to begin as it did, I suppose, but whatever began it, at whatever level of intelligence, cannot be discovered from research today. It is precisely because of millions of years of randomness shaping evolutionary change that we cannot discover a beginning intelligence or intent.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>I haven't read the book by Gardner yet but I'm looking forward to getting it pretty soon. I think Kurzweil and Gardner are quite correct in pointing out that discussions of cosmology fail to mention the role of intelligence at a cosmic level. However, I don't agree with Kurzweil's opinion that we, the human civilization, are the first ones.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the Fermi paradox I can make the following "falsifiable" hypothesis:
<br>
<br>
1) Current cosmology teaches us that the composition of the Cosmos is: 5 percent normal matter (including starts, planets, human brains, technology, etc), 25 percent dark matter and 70 percent dark energy.
<br>
<br>
2)  Dark matter = advanced civilizations 
<br>
<br>
Nobody knows for sure what this dark matter is made of. Perhaps, this dark matter (85% of all matter embedded in galaxies and clusters of galaxies) is the nonbiological portion of the intelligence of ancient advanced civilizations. A huge computronium based on cold computational technology. We are not able to see these civilizations directly because they don't interact in the electromagnetic spectrum. Being cold computers they don't emit radiation or perhaps for reasons beyond our current comprehension they are not made of regular baryonic matter but a more efficient computational form of matter. However, we clearly appreciated its gravitational effects.
<br>
<br>
3)  The computational challenge they are solving
<br>
<br>
Since 1998 several experimental results indicate that a 'mysterious' force is acting in the universe. Dark energy is an unidentified agent that exerts a kind of antigravity force on the whole universe and its accelerating its expansion.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps this 'mysterious' force is nothing more that the result of advance engineering at a cosmic level by the 'dark matter' intelligences. It may be that the major problem of this community of advance beings was to avoid a 'big crunch' of the universe. They may have engineering a solution that we perceive like the dark energy. Now remember that the value of this dark energy (cosmological constant) is fine tune. It seems to have a value that not only accelerates the expansion of the universe but also benefits the formation of massive elliptical or spiral galaxies (98% of the current galaxies). Also, the value seems to be fine tune to favor a healthy rate of large start formation insuring the existence of the heavy elements that constitute our planet, brains, intelligence and technology. Also massive black holes at the center of galaxies seem to be inactive (perhaps more computational power!).

4) Falsifying the hypothesis
<br>
<br>
Using Kurzweil's law of accelerating returns I propose that the first intelligent civilizations capable of engineering at cosmic level appeared in the universe about 4 to 6 billion years after the big bang. Therefore if we check the first few years of the universe we shouldn't detect the consequences of the dark energy. At that time only gravity has to be the main force at a cosmic level, the amount of big galaxies is not as large as today and perhaps the rate of start formation is smaller, black holes at the center of galaxies are more active, etc.  We should have the experimental means to find out these facts pretty soon (James Webb Space Telescope, etc). After 6 billion years we should notice that the influence of dark energy starts. The first superintelligent civilizations turn on the 'dark energy' switch to ensure the generation of additional intelligence and their survival as well. In a few hundred years perhaps, our machine legacy will joint them to contribute to this cosmic goal. Perhaps a study of the large scale configuration of dark matter at 6 billions years after the big bang and comparison with the current one may offer more insight. 
<br>
<br>
I think Kurzweil should partner with some professional open minded cosmologists and summit a paper to one of the leading cosmology journals making some testable predictions based on these or similar ideas. 
<br>
<br>
If intelligence is such a powerful force at a cosmic level a universe that contains extremely advanced intelligence has to be different of one that does not. This is clearly a falsifiable scientific hypothesis.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>First off the possible connection between dark matter and the intelligent cosmos is a really fascinating idea I've seen no where else.  Well done.
<br>
<br>
Secondly reading this post, as well as Ray's introduction to the book I am reminded of the visionary architect Paolo Soleri and his philosophy.  I wonder if anyone else here is familiar with him. 
<br>
<br>
He coined the term "arcology" back in the 1970s to describe his idea of architecture + ecology.  He saw the need for architeture to evolve to more complex, dense and integrated structures.  The implications were both that these were better ecologically for the earth and obvious precursors to future extraterrestrial constructions. 
<br>
<br>
He has been building his vision in the desert of Arizona for 20 years, Arcosanti.  It's a fun place to visit. 
<br>
<br>
His thinking about all this led him (in a way that makes sense if you read his writing) to state his philosophy in a book called: "The Bridge Between Matter and Spirit is Matter Becoming Spirit."    This book was written in 1973 and may not be in print any longer. 
<br>
<br>
It's interesting that his ideas so closely follow those now being advanced by hard scientists.   He also wrote a book called "The Omega Seed: An Eschatological Hypothesis" that was more detailed and extended and included the ideas of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. 
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I remember these books and probably have them in storage somewhere and am now interested in rereading them. </p></td>

Dear PredictionBoy,
<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but I thought that, on this forum, it was practically taken for granted that the first intelligent life-form to evolve on a planet ALWAYS* immediately exterminates the other local contenders for that position.
<br>
<br>
And as for the putative non-existence of other intelligent life-forms in our observable universe - I'd attribute that merely to our poor powers of observation
<br>
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Redakteur
<br>
<br>
<br>
*Does the use of upper-case letters here to emphasize single words and phrases award me "points" according to Baez's crackpot index? I'd use boldface or italics if I knew how.</p></td>

If dark energy was switched on it should have been noticed. If there was a change in the rate of cosmological expansion from 0 to a finite speed at some time in the past, you would notice a "spike" in starlight redshift frequency in some areas of the universe, right? 
<br>
<br>
I guess you could argue that ETI's technology was advanced enough for them to hide any signs of their messing with the entire universe, but then the discussion becomes rhetorical, they could in theory do anything they wanted, including planting this idea in our heads that they're made of dark energy and then never leave any clues just to mess with us. 
<br>
<br>
I am really eager to find out what all that dark energy is though, I don't get how some people can not care about the fact that 80% of the fucking universe is unknown. </p></td>
