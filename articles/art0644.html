<p>An exciting revolution in health care and medical <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> looms 
              large on the horizon. Yet the agents of change will be microscopically 
              small, <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> products of a new discipline known as <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>. 
              Nanotechnology is the <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>ering of molecularly precise <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a>s&#8212;typically 
              0.1 microns or smaller&#8212;and, ultimately, molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s. 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanomedicine_entry.html">Nanomedicine</a><sup>1-4</sup> is the application of nanotechnology 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/medicine_entry.html">medicine</a>. It is the preservation and improvement of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> health, 
              using molecular tools and molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> of the human body. 
              Present-day nanomedicine exploits carefully structured nanoparticles 
              such as dendrimers,<sup>5</sup> <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> fullerenes (<a class="thought" href="entries/buckyball_entry.html">buckyball</a>s)<sup>6</sup> 
              and nanoshells<sup>7</sup> to target specific tissues and organs. 
              These nanoparticles may serve as diagnostic and therapeutic antiviral, 
              antitumor or anticancer agents. But as this technology matures in 
              the years ahead, complex nanodevices and even nanorobots will be 
              fabricated, first of <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> materials but later using more durable 
              materials such as diamond to achieve the most powerful results. 
            </p>
<h2>Early Vision</h2>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Can it be that someday nanorobots 
              will be able to travel through the body <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">search</a>ing out and clearing 
              up <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s, such as an arterial atheromatous plaque?<sup>8</sup>
</span>The first and most famous scientist to voice this possibility 
              was the late Nobel physicist Richard P. Feynman. In his remarkably 
              prescient 1959 talk &#8220;There&#8217;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,&#8221; Feynman 
              proposed employing machine tools to make smaller machine tools, 
              these to be used in turn to make still smaller machine tools, and 
              so on all the way down to the atomic level, noting that this is 
              &#8220;a development which I think cannot be avoided.&#8221;<sup>9</sup></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB">Feynman 
              was clearly aware of the potential medical applications of this 
              new technology. </span>He offered the first known proposal for a 
              nanorobotic surgical procedure to cure heart disease: &#8220;A friend 
              of mine (Albert R. Hibbs) suggests a very interesting possibility 
              for relatively small machines. He says that, although it is a very 
              wild idea, it would be interesting in surgery if you could swallow 
              the surgeon. You put the mechanical surgeon inside the blood vessel 
              and it goes into the heart and looks around. (Of course the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              has to be fed out.) It finds out which valve is the faulty one and 
              takes a little knife and slices it out. ...[Imagine] that we can 
              manufacture an <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a> that maneuvers at that level!... Other small 
              machines might be permanently incorporated in the body to assist 
              some inadequately functioning organ.&#8221;<sup>9</sup></p>

              are ongoing attempts to build microrobots for <i>in vivo</i> medical 
              use. In 2002, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

              spinning screws intended to swim along veins and carry drugs to 
              infected tissues or even to burrow into tumors and kill them with 
              heat.<sup>10</sup> </span>In 2003, the &#8220;MR-Sub&#8221; project of Martel&#8217;s 
              group at the NanoRobotics Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal 
              tested using variable <a class="thought" href="entries/mri_entry.html">MRI</a> magnetic fields to generate forces on 
              an untethered microrobot containing ferromagnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/particle_entry.html">particle</a>s, developing 
              sufficient propulsive power to direct the small <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> through the 
              human body.<sup>11</sup> Brad Nelson&#8217;s team at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 
              Zurich continued this approach. </span>In 2005 they reported the 
              fabrication of a microscopic <a class="thought" href="entries/robot_entry.html">robot</a> small enough (~200 microns<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">) to be injected into the body through a syringe. 
              </span>They hope this device or its descendants might someday be 
              used to deliver drugs or perform minimally invasive eye surgery.<sup>12</sup> 
              Nelson&#8217;s simple microrobot has successfully maneuvered through a 
              watery maze using external <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> from magnetic fields, with different 
              frequencies able to vibrate different mechanical parts on the device 
              to maintain selective control of different functions. Gordon&#8217;s group 
              at the University of Manitoba has also proposed magnetically-controlled 
              &#8220;cytobots&#8221; and &#8220;karyobots&#8221; for performing <a class="thought" href="entries/wireless_entry.html">wireless</a> intracellular

              diamondoid nanometer-scale parts like molecular gears and bearings.<sup>14</sup>
</span>These nanorobots will possess a full panoply of autonomous 
              subsystems including onboard sensors, motors, manipulators, power

              will prove increasingly difficult as machine structures become more 
              complex. Making complex nanorobotic <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s requires manufacturing 
              techniques that can build a molecular structure by what is called 
              positional assembly. This will involve picking and placing molecular 
              parts one by one, moving them along controlled trajectories much 
              like the robot arms that manufacture cars on automobile assembly 
              lines. The procedure is then repeated over and over with all the 
              different parts until the final product, such as a medical nanorobot, 
              is fully assembled.<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"></span></p>

            vascular system or at the ends of catheters into various vessels and 
            other cavities in the human body. A surgical nanorobot, programmed 
            or guided by a human surgeon, could act as an semi-autonomous on-site

            <i>in situ</i> in aqueous solution, with 26 nm thick twisted strands 
            revealed inside the cell wall after mechanically peeling back large 
            patches of the outer cell wall.<sup>30</sup> &#160;<o:p></o:p>Future 
            nanorobots equipped with operating instruments and mobility will be 
            able to perform precise and refined intracellular surgeries which 
            are beyond the capabilities of direct manipulation by the human hand. 
            We envision biocompatible<sup>31</sup> surgical nanorobots that can 
            find and eliminate isolated <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>ous cells, remove microvascular 
            obstructions and recondition vascular endothelial cells, perform &#8220;noninvasive&#8221; 
            tissue and organ transplants, conduct molecular repairs on traumatized 
            extracellular and intracellular structures, and even exchange new 
            whole chromosomes for old ones inside individual living human cells.
