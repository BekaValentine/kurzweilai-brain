<div class="TeaserText">National Federation of the Blind (NFB) founder Dr. Kenneth Jernigan "realized that the pace of technology was accelerating, and these hastening advances would either be liberating for blind people, or would represent another barrier," said Ray Kurzweil in a speech at NFB's 2003 annual convention. Jernigan's solution, a research and training institute, was an example of the power of an idea.</div>

              National Federation of the Blind</a> Convention Banquet, July 3, 
              2003, Louisville, KY. Published on KurzweilAI.net July 4, 2003.</i></p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There's been a series of books recently by an author 
              named J.K. Rowling.&#160; The books are about magic and a young wizard 
              named Harry.&#160; I wonder if any of you have heard of these books?</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Well, when I was eight years old, I also read a series 
              of books about a young wizard, only his name was not Harry, it was 
              Tom, Tom Swift, Junior.&#160; He also used magic, only his magic was 
              the magic of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, and <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a>.&#160; </p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> was always the same: Like master Potter, Tom would 
              get himself into a terrible predicament.&#160; The <a class="thought" href="entries/fate_entry.html">fate</a> of Tom and his 
              friends, and often the rest of the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> race, hung in the balance.&#160; 
              Tom would retreat to his basement lab, and think about how to solve 
              the problem.&#160; This, then, was the dramatic tension in each of the 
              33 books in this series (There were only 9 when I started to read 
              them in 1956): what ingenious idea would Tom and his friends come 
              up with to save the day?&#160; The moral of these tales was simple: the 
              power of the right idea to overcome a seemingly overwhelming challenge.&#160; 
            </p>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To this day, I continue to be convinced of this <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a>: no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what quandaries we face&amp;#8212business problems, 
              health issues, relationship difficulties, as well as the great social 
              and cultural challenges of our time&#8212;there exists an idea that 
              will enable us to prevail.&#160; Furthermore, we can find that idea.&#160; 
              And when we find it, we need to <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a> it.&#160; </p>
<p>The power of an idea&#8212;this is itself an idea, one that has 
              inspired me since a young age.&#160; </p>
<p>Around the same <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> that I was reading the Tom Swift, Jr. series, 
              I recall my grandfather coming back from his first return visit 
              to Europe with two key remembrances.&#160; One was the gracious treatment 
              by the Austrians and Germans, the same people who had forced him 
              to flee in 1938.&#160; The other was a rare opportunity he had been given 
              to handle with his own hands some original manuscripts by Leonardo 
              daVinci.&#160; Both recollections influenced me, but the latter is one 
              I've returned to many times.&#160; He described the <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a> with reverence, 
              as if he had touched the work of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> himself.&#160; This, then, was the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> that I was raised with: veneration for <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/creativity_entry.html">creativity</a> 
              and the power of ideas.&#160; </p>
<p>Let me give you an example, one that many of you are familiar with, 
              but I can give you my spin on it.&#160; There was a young blind boy who 
              grew up on a farm in Tennessee named Kenneth Jernigan.&#160; He evolved 
              an idea that would come to shape not only his own <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, but the 
              lives of his friends and colleagues, and, like the hero of my youth, 
              the rest of the world as well.&#160; </p>
<p>One aspect of this idea is that blindness is an inconvenience, 
              that the limitations of this disability can be overcome and need 
              not result in a handicap.&#160; But Dr. Jernigan's idea went beyond this 
              simple goal.&#160; He went on to address the key challenges to realize 
              it.&#160; </p>
<p>First of all, he recognized that in <a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> to overcome a handicap, 
              one has to tackle the practical issues of mastering alternative 
              ways of getting things done.&#160; As with other sweeping ideas, this 
              one idea generates many others, for example, Braille <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>, 
              modern mobility training, adaptive <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, training to use the 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, funding to provide the training, and so on.&#160; </p>
<p>Another key realization of Dr. Jernigan was that of even greater 
              consequence than addressing these practical issues was the issue 
              of attitude.&#160; In Dr. Jernigan's autobiography and in his many inspiring 
              speeches to this convention&amp;#8212a tradition that Dr. Maurer has 
              ably continued&#8212;he illustrated the diverse ways in which <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> 
              expresses a negative attitude concerning the capabilities of the 
              blind.&#160; I've personally been involved with blindness <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              and the National Federation of the Blind for about 30 years now, 
              and I can share with you my own clear <a class="thought" href="entries/perception_entry.html">perception</a> that there has 
              been a profound sea change by <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> in terms of these detrimental 
              attitudes.&#160; Although there is still much more to do, the efforts 
              of Dr. Jernigan, Dr. Maurer, and the tens of thousands of federationists 
              have truly altered these harmful stereotypes.&#160; The National Federation 
              of the Blind has truly changed what it means to be blind.&#160; </p>
<p>However, Dr. Jernigan had an even more <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant insight than this.&#160; 
              More significant than <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>'s attitudes was the attitude of the 
              blind person herself.&#160; Dr. Jernigan wrote that "the trouble is that 
              blind people, being part of the culture, have accepted these [negative] 
              notions themselves too often, and have, therefore, done much to 
              make it come true.&#160; It's a vicious circle."</p>
<p>He tells an interesting story about a course he took in college.&#160; 
              "Early in my freshman year," Dr. Jernigan writes, "I went to one 
              of my professors and said to him, 'I want to do everything that's 
              needed. I don't want any special favors or privileges. I want to 
              compete on terms of equality with the other students here. . . . 
              Once in a while there may be a few things that I will need to do 
              a little differently, but I hope there won't be many such things 
              and that they won't be sufficient to make a difference in my overall 
              performance.&#160; Specifically,' I said, 'since fitting footnotes onto 
              a sheet of typing constitutes some problem, I would hope that I 
              would be able to omit footnotes from term papers and themes. I shall 
              certainly do all the <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> involved, and will type the papers 
              myself.'"</p>
<p>"It sounds pretty good. Don't you think? It's a fairly plausible 
              argument. I put all of the right words: 'no special favors, no special 
              treatment, no unreasonable privileges.' Then, I asked the professor: 
              'Is it all right if I proceed in that manner?'"</p>
<p>Dr. Jernigan continues.&#160; "His answer was blunt and to the point.&#160; 
              'Hell no,' he barked. 'It's not all right. Look, you have come here 
              telling me that you can compete on terms of equality, and you have 
              made all of this speech about how you want to do it on equal terms 
              with everybody else. . . . Now, you either can or you can't.&#160; I 
              could let you get by without the footnotes and probably nobody would 
              criticize me for it. But when you are through with my classes and 
              are graduating, you are going to want a recommendation. At that 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> you'll get your feelings hurt if I say, "He's not capable 
              of competing on terms of real equality with others, but he can do 
              a good job considering that he's blind.". . .Therefore, you 
              are either going to pass my courses in such a way that I can honestly 
              give you good recommendations, or I'll flunk you. Take it either 
              way you want it.'</p>
<p>"That was one of the finest things that ever happened to me," Dr. 
              Jernigan concluded.&#160; </p>
<p>Dr. Jernigan realized that each of us has to start with ourselves.&#160; 
              It's a profound insight, and it goes far beyond blindness.&#160; We cannot 
              deal with the varied forms of prejudice in <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>, whether it's 
              a disabled person facing uninformed stereotypes, a black man facing 
              racism, a Jew facing anti-Semitism, or a woman facing sexism, without 
              first overcoming the vestiges of these attitudes in ourselves and 
              about ourselves.&#160; </p>
<p>As with the practical considerations of developing alternative 
              approaches to accomplishing tasks, this singular idea also generates 
              many other ideas.&#160; Dr. Jernigan realized that to genuinely develop 
              the needed confidence, an organization was needed.&#160; He discovered 
              that organization when he joined the NFB in 1949, and <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>d 
              his first national convention in 1952.&#160; </p>
<p>That was about 23 years before my own first national NFB convention 
              in 1975.&#160; I came to realize Dr. Jernigan's key idea in seeing the 
              confidence of the people at this convention.&#160; It was further reinforced 
              when I ran into all of these incredibly confident young blind people 
              from Iowa.&#160; What was so special about Iowa, I wondered?&#160;&#160; But I 
              quickly discovered the <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> for their confidence had to do with 
              a particularly creative director of blind services named Kenneth 
              Jernigan.&#160; </p>
<p>My own <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>'s work has been in the field of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>.&#160; I've been 
              involved with blindness <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for three decades now, and I'm 
              continuing to work closely with the NFB in this area.&#160; <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> 
              is one of those enabling factors that Dr. Jernigan realized was 
              needed to fully realize his vision of equality.&#160; So it was fitting 
              that Dr. Jernigan's last major idea was the need for a world-class 
              institute to create blindness <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> for the 21<sup>st</sup> 
              century.&#160; He realized that the pace of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was accelerating, 
              and that these hastening advances would either be liberating for 
              blind people, or would represent another barrier.&#160; Despite his grave 
              illness, he felt that there was no <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> to lose.&#160; </p>
<p>In the last days of his <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>, he expressed total confidence that 
              his vision of the National Federation of the Blind <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">Research</a> and 
              Training Institute would become a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.&#160; I know that there were 
              quite a few people back then&#8212;which was only a few years ago&#8212;who 
              harbored doubts about whether such a daunting vision could truly 
              be realized.&#160; But at the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, having known Dr. Jernigan for over 
              a quarter century, I had no doubt that he would prevail in <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">death</a> 
              as he did in <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">life</a>.&#160; And, of course, if you go to Baltimore today, 
              you can see rising from the site of a once-empty lot one more example 
              of the power of an idea.</p>
