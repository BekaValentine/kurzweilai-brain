<div class="TeaserText">The parts for a DNA synthesizer can now be purchased for approximately $10,000. By 2010 a single person will be able to sequence or synthesize 10^10 bases a day. Within a decade a single person could sequence or synthesize all the DNA describing all the people on the planet many times over in an eight-hour day or sequence his or her own DNA within seconds. Given the power and threat of biological technologies, the only way to ensure safety in the long run is to push research and development as fast as possible. Open and distributed networks of researchers would provide an intelligence gathering capability and a flexible and robust workforce for developing technology. </div>

            <p>THE ADVENT OF THE home molecular <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">biology</a> laboratory is not far 
              off. While there is no <i><a class="thought" href="entries/star_trek_entry.html">Star Trek</a> </i>"Tricorder" in sight, the 
              physical infrastructure of molecular biology is becoming more sophisticated 
              and less expensive every day. Automated <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ation 
              handles an increasing fraction of laboratory tasks that were once 
              the sole province of doctoral level <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers, reducing labor 
              costs and increasing <a class="thought" href="entries/productivity_entry.html">productivity</a>. This <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> is gradually 
              moving into the broader marketplace as laboratories upgrade to new 
              equipment. Older, still very powerful instruments are finding their 
              way into wide distribution, as any cursory tour of eBay will reveal.<sup>1</sup> 
              These factors are contributing to a proliferation that will soon 
              put highly capable tools in the hands of both professionals and 
              amateurs worldwide. There are obvious short term risks from increased 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> to <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a> and sequencing technologies, and the general 
              improvement of technologies used in measuring and manipulating <a class="thought" href="entries/molecule_entry.html">molecule</a>s 
              will soon enable a broad and distributed enhancement in the ability 
              to alter <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. The resulting potential for mischief 
              or mistake causes understandable concern&#8212;there are already 
              public calls by scientists and politicians alike to restrict access 
              to certain technologies, to regulate the direction of biological 
              research, and to censor publication of some new techniques and <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a>. 
              It is questionable, however, whether such efforts will increase 
              security or benefit the public good. Proscription of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> 
              and <a class="thought" href="entries/artifact_entry.html">artifact</a>s generally leads directly to a black market that is 
              difficult to monitor and therefore difficult to police. A superior 
              alternative is the deliberate creation of an open and expansive 
              research community, which may be better able to respond to crises 
              and better able to keep track of research whether in the university 
              or in the garage. </p>
            <h2><b>FACTORS DRIVING THE BIOTECH REVOLUTION </b></h2>
            <p>The development of powerful laboratory tools is enabling ever more 
              sophisticated measurement of biology at the molecular level. Beyond 
              its own <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al <a class="thought" href="entries/utility_entry.html">utility</a>, every new measurement technique creates 
              a new mode of interaction with biological systems. Moreover, new 
              measurement techniques can swiftly become means to manipulate biological 
              systems. Estimating the pace of improvement of representative technologies 
              is one way to illustrate the rate at which our ability to interact 
              with and manipulate biological systems is changing. </p>
            <p>For example, chemically synthesized DNA fragments, or oligonucleotides, 
              can be used in DNA <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>, in the fabrication of gene <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              arrays ("gene chips"), and to make larger constructs for genetic 
              manipulation. Mail-<a class="thought" href="entries/order_entry.html">order</a> oligonucleotides were with much fanfare 
              recently used to build a functional poliovirus <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> from constituent 
              molecules for the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>.<sup>2</sup> The rate at which DNA 
              synthesis <a class="thought" href="entries/capacity_entry.html">capacity</a> is changing is thus a measure of the improvement 
              in our ability to manipulate biological systems and biological information. 
              Similarly, improvements in DNA sequencing capabilities are a measure 
              of our ability to read biological information; in particular the 
              ability to proofread the results of DNA synthesis. Here I refer 
              to such technology, whether instrument or molecule, as "biological 
              technology." </p>
            <h2><b>THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE THROUGH THE PRISM OF MOORE'S 
              LAW </b></h2>
            <p>Figure 1 contains estimates of potential daily productivity of 
              DNA synthesis and sequencing based on commercially available instruments, 
              including the time necessary to prepare samples. There have been 
              only a few generations of instruments&#8212;there is thus a limited 
              amount of data for examination. These estimates are not intended 
              to absolutely quantify a rate of change, but rather to capture the 
              essence of the trends. Several technologies used in <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/structure_entry.html">structure</a> 
              determination show similar trends (Figure 2), suggesting a general 
              rapid improvement of biological technologies. As a reference, Moore's 
              Law, which describes the doubling time of the <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/transistor_entry.html">transistor</a>s 
              on microchips, is also shown in Figure 1. </p>

            <p><b><font size="1">FIG. 1. </font></b><font size="1">On this semi-log 
              plot, DNA synthesis and sequencing productivity are both increasing 
              at least as fast as Moore?s Law (upwards triangles). Each of the 
              remaining points is the amount of DNA that can be processed by one 
              person running multiple <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>s for one eight hour day, defined 
              by the time required for preprocessing and sample handling on each 
              instrument. Not included in these estimates is the time required 
              for sequence analysis. For comparison, the approximate rate at which 
              a single molecule of <i>E. coli </i>DNA Polymerase III replicates 
              DNA is shown (dashed horizontal line), referenced to an eight-hour

            <p>Comparing anything to <a class="thought" href="javascript:loadBrain('Moore\'s Law')">Moore's Law</a> is already a clich&#195;&#169;, but doing 
              so remains a useful <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> to gauge our expectations of how other 
              technologies will affect socioeconomic change. This comparison starts 
              with the observation that <a class="thought" href="entries/chip_entry.html">chip</a> doubling times are a consequence 
              of the planning intrinsic to the <a class="thought" href="entries/semiconductor_entry.html">semiconductor</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> industry.<sup>3</sup> 
              Moore's Law is primarily a function of the capital cost and resource 
              allocation necessary to build chip fabrication plants. In addition, 
              for much of the last thirty years there was feedback between the 
              ability to design new chips and the computational power of the chips 
              used in the design process. </p>
            <p>We can now see the beginnings of a similar effect in the development 
              of biological technologies. For example, enzymes optimized for laboratory 
              conditions are used in the preparation of DNA for sequencing, where 
              earlier sequencing technologies were part of characterizing and 
              modifying those enzymes. Recombinant proteins are used every day 
              to elucidate interactions between proteins within <a class="thought" href="entries/organism_entry.html">organism</a>s, and 
              that information is already being used to design and build new protein 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/network_entry.html">network</a>s. Enzymes are directly used in a process known as Pyrosequencing,<sup>4</sup> 
              and its performance (Figure 1) is an indication of what will happen 
              when we begin to manipulate biology, using biology, on a large scale 
              at many levels of <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a>. </p>
            <p><img height="405" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011060342im_/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/images/Carlson(PaceAndProliferation)figure2.gif" width="400"></p>
            <p><b><font size="1">FIG. 2. </font></b><font size="1">The dramatic 
              improvement in the time required to determine protein structures 
              is evidence of a general trend towards increased productivity in 
              biological technologies. Many of the technologies used in finding 
              protein structures are used widely in biology for other purposes. 
              Raw estimates of time to collect and crystallize recombinant proteins, 
              to take x-ray data, and to build structural models were compiled 
              by Richard Yu (The Molecular Sciences Institute, Berkeley, CA) based 
              on his experience and a survey of five additional crystallographers. 
              From these estimates, the shortest time and mean time to find protein 
              structures were computed. The time required for each step can vary 
              significantly depending upon the protein. For example, successful 
              crystallization may take anywhere between hours and months of effort. 
              The difference between the estimates of the average time to structure 
              and the shortest time to structure illustrates the difficulty in 
              absolutely quantifying productivity.</font></p>
            <p>Other observers have compared increases in the total number of 
              sequenced genes to Moore's law. But this mixes proverbial apples 
              and oranges because total sequencing productivity is a measure of 
              total industrial capacity (the number of sequencing instruments 
              produced and in <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a>) whereas the number of transistors is 
              ostensibly a measure of the potential productivity improvements 
              enabled by each <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a> computer. The total number of sequenced 
              genes is more <a class="thought" href="entries/analog_entry.html">analog</a>ous to the total number of computer chips in 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/existence_entry.html">existence</a>, or possibly the total number of computational operations 
              enabled by those chips. Comparing Moore's Law to estimates of the 
              daily productivity of one person at a biology laboratory bench is 
              appropriate because that productivity determines how much benefit, 
              or havoc, one person can generate. </p>
            <p>An alternative statement of Moore's Law is "Computational resources 
              for a fixed price double every 18 months." Assuming for a moment 
              that the cost of appropriately skilled labor has remained constant, 
              the units of the vertical axis in Figure 1, "bases synthesized&#195;&#162;&#194;&#133;&#195;&#144;f=GET http://<a class="thought" href="entries/www_entry.html">www</a>.neurosurgery-online.<a class="thought" href="entries/com_entry.html">com</a>/b day," match the metric of resource 
              cost, which is explicitly labor in this case. Note that this assumption 
              is too conservative. Labor costs associated with sequencing have 
              actually fallen as bench top laboratory techniques that once required 
              a doctorate's worth of experience have been replaced by automated 
              processes that can be monitored by a technician with only limited 
              training (see below). The capability of individuals has improved 
              dramatically over the last 15 years. </p>
            <p>The rapid increase in sequencing productivity is the primary <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a> 
              that the private effort by Celera was able to sequence the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> 
              genome so quickly. Money was always available to buy many slow machines&#8212;this 
              was, after all, the original plan for the publicly funded genome 
              project&amp;#8212but coordinating the effort and paying for the labor 
              to run those machines was prohibitively expensive for a private 
              project. The advent of new technology provided an opportunity for 
              a new approach, which Celera seized. Only when sequencing instruments 
              became sufficiently automated that labor was reduced to loading 
              samples, whereupon one person could shepherd several machines and 
              the total task could be completed in an interesting time interval, 
              was a commercial effort possible. This required highly centralized 
              sequence production facilities in order to minimize the number of 
              instruments, given their individual high cost. This infrastructure 
              is similar to that of microchip fabrication plants, otherwise known 
              as "chip fabs." </p>
            <p>However, because sequencing instruments are much closer to commodities 
              than are the plasma etchers and vapor deposition systems used in 
              microchip production, it is not at all obvious that the current 
              centralized model will be relevant to the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> of biological technology. 
              On the contrary, because there has been to date only limited feedback 
              between biological discovery and the technology it enables, it seems 
              more likely that low cost, highly capable instrumentation will be 
              broadly distributed. Sequencing machines are already widespread 
              in laboratories and there is clear demand for faster, cheaper instruments. 
            </p>
            <p>More significantly, the long term distribution and development 
              of biological technology is likely to be largely unconstrained by 
              economic considerations. While Moore's Law is a forecast based on 
              understandable large capital costs and projected improvements in 
              existing technologies, which to a great extent determined its remarkably 
              constant behavior, current <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> in biology is exemplified by 
              successive shifts to new technologies. These technologies share 
              the common scientific inheritance of molecular biology, but in general 
              their <a class="thought" href="entries/implement_entry.html">implement</a>ations as tools emerge independently and have independent 
              scientific and economic impacts. For example, the advent of gene 
              expression chips spawned a new industrial segment with significant 
              market value. Recombinant DNA, gel and capillary sequencing, and 
              monoclonal antibodies have produced similar results. And while the 
              cost of chip fabs has reached upwards of one billion dollars per 
              facility and is expected to increase, there is good reason to expect 
              that the cost of biological manufacturing and sequencing will only 
              decrease. Indeed, the continuing costs of sequencing (expendables 
              such as reagents) have fallen exponentially over the time period 
              covered by Figure 1.<sup>5</sup> Lander <i>et al</i>., state in 
              <i><a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> </i>that by 2000 the total costs of sequencing had fallen 
              by a factor of 100 in ten years, with costs falling by a factor 
              of 2 approximately every eighteen months.<sup>6</sup> With the caveat 
              that there are only limited data to date, it does appear that the 
              total cost of sequencing and synthesis are falling exponentially 
              (Figure 3). </p>
            <p>These trends&#8212;successive shifts to new technologies and increased 
              capability at decreased cost&amp;#8212are likely to continue. In the 
              fifteen years that commercial sequencers have been available, the 
              technology has progressed, using the simple metric in Figure 1, 
              from labor intensive gel slab based instruments, through highly 
              automated capillary electrophoresis based machines, to the partially 
              enzymatic Pyrosequencing process. These techniques are based on 
              chemical analysis of many copies of a given sequence. New technologies 
              under development are aimed at directly reading one copy at a time 
              by directly measuring physical properties of molecules, with a goal 
              of rapidly reading genomes of individual cells. These include efforts 
              to measure differences in ion currents due to size variations between 
              bases as DNA is electrophoresed through a small pore,<sup>7</sup> 
              and measuring differences in force between complimentary bases as 
              double stranded DNA is unzipped by pulling it apart with an atomic 
              force microscope.<sup>8</sup> While physically-based sequencing 
              techniques have historically faced technical difficulties inherent 
              in working with individual molecules, an expanding variety of measurement 
              techniques applied to biological systems will likely yield <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>s

            <h2><b>ANTICIPATING THE FUTURE OF SYNTHESIS AND SEQUENCING </b></h2>
            <p>A rough extrapolation of the curves (as opposed to their tangents) 
              in Figure 1 suggests that by 2010 a single person will be able to 
              sequence or synthesize 10<sup>10</sup> bases a day. These potential 
              productivity numbers should be compared to the three billion bases 
              (3&#194;&#160;X 10<sup>9</sup>) in the human genome. Note that while <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a> 
              may make this productivity level technologically feasible, costs 
              may prohibit reaching it (see Figure 3). Even if actual technological 
              developments do not sustain current trends, the drive towards automation 
              and integration will certainly continue, enhancing distribution. 
              This is the explicit goal of numerous commercial endeavors, particularly 
              those intent on producing the tantalizing "lab on a chip." Tools 
              of this kind will be particularly powerful in the <a class="thought" href="entries/context_entry.html">context</a> of the 
              current labor-consuming processes involved in preparing samples 
              for sequence or expression analysis or in purifying them after synthesis. 
              The "microdiagnostics" company Cepheid, for example, will soon begin 
              selling its GeneXpert <a class="thought" href="entries/platform_entry.html">Platform</a>, which includes technology that spans 
              sample preparation, purification, and detection of <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a> DNA, 
              potentially reducing sample analysis from days to minutes.<sup>9,10</sup> 
              Scientists, clinicians, first responders, epidemiologists, biological 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/weapon_entry.html">weapon</a>s inspectors, and biological weapons producers will appreciate 
              these capabilities equally. </p>
            <p>While it is still early in the development of such platforms, they 
              promise to be another <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ant shift in technology, perhaps helping 
              realize the trends in Figure 1. If those trends are born out, within 
              a decade a single person at the lab bench could sequence or synthesize 
              all the DNA describing all the people on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> many times over 
              in an <i>eight-hour day</i>, even given profligate human reproduction. 
              Alternatively, one person could sequence his or her own DNA within 
              seconds. </p>
            <p>Despite the fantastic nature of these numbers, there is no physical 
              reason why sequencing an individual human genome should take longer 
              than a few minutes. Sequencing a billion bases in a thousand seconds 
              would require querying each base for only a microsecond, which is 
              well within the measurement capability of many physical systems. 
              Inexpensive disk drives, for example, already read the state of 
              magnetic <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a>s at upwards of a billion times a second. Although 
              storage <a class="thought" href="entries/media_entry.html">media</a> is an example of a mature technology, it is also an 
              indication of the sort of interaction that will be possible with 
              biological systems. Indeed, it seems unwise to assume limits on 
              potential applications of our newly developing ability to manipulate 
              and probe <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> at the scale of individual molecules. Every week 
              there are exciting new examples of imaging and manipulation of molecules, 
              or small <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>s such as <a class="thought" href="entries/carbon_entry.html">carbon</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotubes_entry.html">nanotubes</a>, each pushing back previously 
              imagined limits. Figure 1 illustrates how fast an individual enzyme 
              can copy DNA, and hybrid techniques utilizing physical measurement 
              of the activity of individual enzymes may provide extremely rapid 
              sequencing.<sup>11</sup> Yet at some point, despite ever increasing 
              speed, sequencing capabilities will likely reach an asymptote in 
              utility&#8212; how fast is fast enough? </p>
            <p>This raises the question of how much longer effort put into developing 
              rapid sequencing technology will be a wise investment. The greater 
              challenge is sensitivity&amp;#8212biology comes in units of single cells, 
              which is the level we must work at to reprogram biological systems 
              and deal with many <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a>s. <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">Cancer</a> is one such disease. Generally 
              it is not a whole organ or tissue that becomes cancerous, but rather 
              one <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a> that breaks loose from its developmental pathway&amp;#8212due 
              to chance mutations, changes in the environment, or infection&amp;#8212and 
              runs amok. Similarly, many infections essentially begin with attacks 
              by individual pathogens on individual cells, even if many simultaneous 
              such events are necessary to produce full-blown symptoms. This is 
              of obvious concern for scientists and clinicians interested in <a class="thought" href="entries/novel_entry.html">novel</a> 
              pathogens, both natural and artificial. Yet no technology currently 
              emerging from the bench can sequence the genome of a single cell 
              without amplification steps that introduce significant errors (though 
              many academic labs and companies promise this ability soon). Most 
              current technology, particularly that applied to determining interactions 
              between proteins, requires a large number of cells and thus produces 
              data that is an average over the states of those cells. Investigating 
              the metabolic or proteomic state of cells (without the use of genetic 
              modification) is similarly often predominantly limited to large 
              samples. </p>
            <p>Regardless of the direction of technological development, the synthesis 
              and sequencing capabilities available to an individual in the next 
              decade will be impressive, greatly facilitating the task of manipulating 
              biological systems. The cost of each instrument should generally 
              decrease, following the trend of similar commodities, suggesting 
              that the infrastructure of biological technology will be highly 
              distributed. One indication of this trend is that the parts for 
              a DNA <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>&#8212;mostly plumbing and off-the-shelf <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a>s&amp;#8212can 
              now be purchased for approximately $10,000. The assembly effort 
              and monetary sum are similar to that expended by many car and computer 
              hobbyists, and both the parts list and design information sufficient 
              to assemble the synthesizer are available online.<sup>12</sup> </p>
            <p>Despite existing infrastructure that provides for <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a>ing sequences 
              directly into a synthesizer, possession of a DNA synthesizer does 
              not a new organism make. Current chemical synthesis produces only 
              short runs of DNA. Although ingenuity and care are required to assemble 
              full-length genes, the techniques are already described in the scientific 
              literature. Moreover, there is significant economic motivation to 
              make such assembly routine, and multiple companies have been founded 
              to sort out the relevant manufacturing details and to take advantage 
              of the growing demand for long synthetic DNA sequences. Many of 
              these companies provide synthetic DNA via mail based on sequences 
              submitted over the Web, and not all such companies screen ordered 
              sequences against sequences of known pathogens and biological toxins.<sup>13</sup> 
              Even if great care is taken to limit the commercial synthesis of 
              DNA from pathogens or toxins, it is unlikely the chemical tricks 
              and instrumentation that companies develop in the course of building 
              their businesses will remain confined within their walls. Eventually, 
              efficient synthesis will be possible using instruments assembled 
              at home. The diffusion of synthesis capability into the garage will 
              no doubt be slowed by the fact that some the reagents used in chemical 
              DNA synthesis are controlled substances. However, <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> demonstrates 
              that regulating the synthesis of even complex compounds does not 
              greatly inhibit illicit production (see below). The requisite techniques 
              are in fact already highly distributed.</p>
            <h2><b>THE PROLIFERATION OF SKILLS AND MATERIALS IS INEVITABLE </b></h2>
            <p>Beyond information about writing DNA from scratch, extensive instructions 
              on standard <a class="thought" href="entries/chemistry_entry.html">chemistry</a> and molecular biology techniques are available 
              on the Web, notably detailed descriptions of PCR (polymerase chain 
              reaction) and other important DNA manipulation procedures. While 
              some skills are still highly specialized, <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> know-how is permeating 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>al process.<sup>14</sup> For several years community 
              colleges have offered courses of study aimed at providing the biotech 
              industry with skilled technicians. A case in point: when it was 
              founded in 1990, the sequencing facility at the Whitehead Institute 
              Center for Genome Research employed primarily scientists with doctorates. 
              Over the years these PhD's were gradually replaced by masters degrees, 
              then bachelors and associates degrees. Now many of the staff have 
              completed only a six month qualification course at local community 
              college or are recent Tibetan immigrants who received training in 
              basic skills at the Institute.<sup>15</sup> These technicians are 
              educated in all the steps necessary to shepherd DNA from incoming 
              sample to outgoing sequence information, including generating <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a> 
              containing DNA from other organisms. This point bears repeating: 
              Creating genetically modified organisms is now the province of immigrants 
              with little formal education. More sophisticated practical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> 
              is available to many AP Biology students in high school. Pointing 
              the way into the future, several universities now teach a Molecular 
              Biology for <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">Engine</a>ers class. Exploring the limits of this trend 
              is a class taught at MIT wherein students ranging from undergraduates 
              to post-docs design and test new genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/circuit_entry.html">circuit</a>s.<sup>16</sup> 
              Successful designs will be included in a databook of biological 
              parts.<sup>17</sup> </p>
            <p>Where design expertise exceeds practical experience, commercially 
              available kits include recipes that allow moving genes between organisms 
              by following simple recipes. The process might be slightly more 
              complicated than baking <a class="thought" href="entries/cookie_entry.html">cookie</a>s, but it is for the most part less 
              complicated than making wine or beer. This broad distribution of 
              biological technology naturally leads to questions of how it will 
              be applied. Our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> is just beginning discussions about the 
              role of genetic modifications and the applications of cellular cloning. 
            </p>
            <p>More important, perhaps, is the debate over regulation of research 
              and who will be permitted access to which biological technologies. 
              But it is unlikely that regulation of materiel or skills will produce 
              an increase in public safety. The industrial demand alone for skilled 
              biotechnology workers has increased 14&#194;&#150;17% per year for the last 
              decade, and many of these workers come from overseas.<sup>18</sup> 
              Not all these workers will remain in this country, and it is safe 
              to say many of those who leave will make use of their skills elsewhere. 
              If we decide to try to limit the practice of certain methods, it 
              will be unrealistic to try to centrally monitor every skilled person 
              in this or any other country. We certainly cannot simply "unteach" 
              the relevant skills to prevent unauthorized use, and any <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> 
              to limit the proliferation of skills would cripple that portion 
              of the U.S. economy reliant upon biological technologies. </p>
            <p>Perhaps more problematic than distributed skills will be ubiquitous 
              materials. The widespread distillation of alcohol during the Prohibition 
              period in the U.S. and the proliferation of modern illegal drug 
              synthesis labs both illustrate the principle that outlawing chemical 
              products merely leads to black markets more difficult to observe 
              and regulate than open markets. </p>
            <p>Effective regulation relies on effective enforcement, which in 
              turn requires effective detection. The extent of illegal drug production 
              in the United States and previous failures to detect illicit biological 
              weapons production gives some indication of the relevant challenges 
              of detection and enforcement. Approximately 8,000 clandestine drug 
              laboratories were seized in the U.S. in 2001, with the vast majority 
              of those being "Mom and Pop" operations producing less than five 
              kilograms per day.<sup>19</sup> Yet despite the large number of 
              seizures (which has on average remained constant for the last decade) 
              illegal drug use is apparently still rising.<sup>20</sup> This failure 
              of enforcement, and the detection failure demonstrated when Western 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> services failed to uncover the existence of extensive 
              bioweapons <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>s in the former Soviet Union and Iraq,<sup>21</sup> 
              provide explicit challenges to the notion that the risks posed by 
              mistakes or mischief resulting from biological technologies can 
              be mitigated through regulation.</p>
            <p>Given the potential power of biological technologies, it is worth 
              considering whether open markets are more, or less, desirable than 
              the inevitable black markets that would emerge with regulation. 
              Those black markets would be, by definition, beyond regulation. 
              More importantly, in this case, they would be opaque. </p>
            <p>The real threat from distributed biological technologies lies neither 
              in their development nor use, per se, but rather that biological 
              systems may be the subject of accidental or intentional modification 
              without the knowledge of those who might be harmed. Because this 
              may include significant human, <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>, or plant populations, it 
              behooves us to maximize our knowledge about what sort of experimentation 
              is taking place around the world. Unfortunately (though understandably), 
              the first response to incidents such as the anthrax attacks in the 
              fall of 2001 is to attempt to improve public safety through means 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/paradox_entry.html">paradox</a>ically often limit our capabilities to gather such information.<sup>22</sup></p>
            <h2><b>THE FALSE PROMISE OF REGULATION </b></h2>
            <p>Some view as an immediate threat the proliferation of technologies 
              useful in manipulating biological systems: Passionate arguments 
              are being made that research should be slowed and that some research 
              should be avoided altogether. "Letting the genie out of the bottle" 
              is a ubiquitous concern, one that has been loudly voiced in other 
              fields over the years and is meant to <a class="thought" href="entries/single_electron_transfer_entry.html">set</a> off alarm bells about 
              biological research. </p>
            <p>A favorite rhetorical device in this discussion is the comparison 
              of nuclear technologies with biological technologies. Success in 
              limiting the development and spread of nuclear technologies is taken 
              to mean similar feats are possible with biological technologies. 
              But this sort of argument fails to consider the logistical, let 
              alone ethical, differences between embargoing raw fissionable materials 
              used in nuclear or radiological weapons and embargoing biological 
              technology or even biology itself. </p>
            <p>Regulation of the development of nuclear weapons has been successful 
              only because access to raw fissionable materials has, fortunately, 
              been relatively easy to restrict. However, both the knowledge and 
              tools necessary to construct rudimentary weapons have for decades 
              been highly distributed. It is arguable that, with some effort, 
              construction of a rudimentary nuclear device is within the capabilities 
              of most <a class="thought" href="entries/physics_entry.html">physics</a> and engineering college graduates who have access 
              to a basic machine shop. Building nuclear devices is thus theoretically 
              quite feasible but physically difficult, even for the knowledgeable, 
              because the raw materials are simply not available. Yet the raw 
              stuff of biology has always been readily at hand, and our schools 
              and industries are now equipping students with the skills to manipulate 
              biological systems through powerful and distributed technology. 
              Because skills are already widespread and will only become more 
              so, altering and <a class="thought" href="entries/reverse_engineering_entry.html">reverse engineering</a> biological systems will become 
              both easier and more common. Regulation can do little to alter this 
              trend. </p>
            <p>If strict regulation held promise of real protection, it would 
              be well worth considering. But regulation is inherently leaky, and 
              it is more often a form of management than blanket prohibition. 
              Certainly no category of crime has ever been eliminated through 
              legal prohibition. In this <a class="thought" href="entries/light_entry.html">light</a>, we must ask how many infringements 
              of potential regulation of biological technologies we are willing 
              to risk. Further, will the threat of sanctions such as imprisonment 
              ever be enough to dissuade infringement? Given the potential damage 
              wrought by misuses of the technology, we may never be satisfied 
              that such sanctions would constitute a repayment of debt to society, 
              the fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system. The damages 
              may always exceed any punishment meted out to those deemed criminal. 
              These considerations come down to how we choose to balance the risks 
              and consequences of infringement against whatever safety may be 
              found in regulation and attempts at enforcement. More important 
              than this tenuous safety, however, is the potential danger of enforced 
              ignorance. In the end, we must decide not whether we are willing 
              to risk damages caused by biological technology, but whether limiting 
              the general direction of biological research in the coming years 
              will enable us to deal with the outcome of mischief or mistake. 
              We must decide if we are willing to take the risk of being unprepared. 
            </p>
            <p>There are currently calls to limit research in the United States 
              on the basic biology of many pathogens to preempt their use as bioweapons,<sup>22</sup> 
              and the possession and transport of many pathogens was legislated 
              into criminality by the Patriot Act.<sup>23</sup> The main difficulty 
              with this approach is not that it assumes the basic biology of pathogens 
              is static&#8212;which because of either natural variation or human 
              intervention it is not&amp;#8212but rather that it assumes we have already 
              catalogued all possible natural pathogens, that we already know 
              how to detect and defeat known and unknown pathogens, and that rogue 
              &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Element')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Element')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s will not be able to learn how to manipulate pathogens and 
              toxins on their own. These assumptions are demonstrably false. Pathogens 
              ranging from HIV to &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis &lt;/i&gt;to &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/i&gt;(which 
              causes malaria) have successfully evolved to escape formerly effective 
              treatments. New human pathogens are constantly emerging, which as 
              in the case of SARS might be identified quickly but require much 
              longer to develop treatments against. In the last century &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Government')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Government')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt;s 
              and independent organizations alike have developed and used biological 
              weapons. Restricting our own research will merely leave us less 
              prepared for the inevitable emergence of new natural and artificial 
              biological threats. Moreover, it is naive to think we can successfully 
              limit access to existing pertinent information within our current 
              economic and political framework. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As is clear from recent efforts to limit peer-to-peer file sharing 
              on the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Internet')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Internet')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, in today's environment strict prohibition of information 
              flow can only be achieved by quarantine&amp;#8212unplugging wires and 
              blocking &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Wireless')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Wireless')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;wireless&lt;/a&gt; transmission. Thwarted by the difficulty of such 
              endeavors, &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Music')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Music')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; conglomerates have resorted to flooding file &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Server')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Server')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;s 
              with corrupted files (camouflage),&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; and requesting the 
              legal authority to engage in preemptive cracking of file trader's 
              computers (sabotage).&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neither strategy is likely to be a long term solution of controlling 
              information for the music industry, and similar efforts to regulate 
              biological technologies are bound to be more difficult still. Attempting 
              to maintain control of information and instrumentation will be a 
              futile task in light of the increasingly sophisticated biological 
              technologies blossoming around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the most advanced research and instrumentation developments 
              may occur first in fully industrialized countries such as the US, 
              where &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Export')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Export')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;export&lt;/a&gt; might be controlled, other countries are developing 
              a skill base that will enable broad domestic utilization of biological 
              technologies. China has an aggressive program in plant biotechnology, 
              and as of 2002 plans to increase funding 400% by 2005.&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; 
              This energetic investment also exists in the Chinese private sector, 
              and the national scientific establishment is attempting to lure 
              foreign trained scientists to return with lucrative financial packages.&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; 
              India is in the process of tripling funding to its national biotech 
              center,&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and is promoting the development and use of 
              genetically modified crops throughout Asia.&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; Singapore 
              has for many years made a practice of recruiting foreign scientists.&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; 
              Taiwan is investing large amounts in biotechnology&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; 
              and is seeking citizens to return home to build up biotechnology 
              in academia and industry.&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; A Brazilian coalition recently 
              demonstrated sophisticated domestic use of biological technologies 
              by successfully sequencing the plant pathogen &lt;i&gt;X. fastidiosa &lt;/i&gt;in 
              2000.&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given these developments in the context of the increase in individual 
              capabilities and the independent &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Reduction')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Reduction')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;reduction&lt;/a&gt; in cost, it is unrealistic 
              to think biological technologies can be isolated within the borders 
              of officially sanctioned countries. Even if such a regime were implemented, 
              it would merely include those countries that already have a particular 
              technology. We can do little to take technology away from those 
              in whose hands it was developed and resides. The best strategy going 
              forward is in fact to encourage such efforts at all levels in an 
              open environment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHAT SHOULD (AND SHOULD NOT) BE DONE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If regulation is not merely an ineffective option but will actually 
              be an impediment to security, how can we attempt to mitigate coming 
              risks? The goal is clearly to counter both mistakes in the laboratory 
              and weapons created from biological &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Component')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Component')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;component&lt;/a&gt;s and, ideally, to 
              make such threats irrelevant before they become a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It may be many decades before our understanding of biology provides 
              for the requisite rapid detection, analysis, and response. Fortunately, 
              it is also probably true that we have some time to prepare before 
              both technology and skills become truly pervasive. In the meantime, 
              we can lay the groundwork for an increase in security with dramatically 
              improved &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Communication')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Communication')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; and focused technology development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We should focus on three challenges: &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1) We should resist the impulse to restrict research and the flow 
              of information. Ignorance will help no one in the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Event')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Event')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; of an emergent 
              threat and, given the pace and proliferation of biological technologies, 
              the likelihood of threats will increase in coming years. Among the 
              greatest threats we face is that potentially detrimental work will 
              proceed while we sit on our hands. If we are not ourselves pushing 
              the boundaries of what is known about how pathogens work or ways 
              to manipulate them, we are by definition at a disadvantage. Put 
              simply, it will be much easier to keep track of what is in the wind 
              if we don't have our heads in the sand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2) The best way to keep apprised of the activities of both amateurs 
              and professionals is to establish open networks of researchers, 
              perhaps modeled on the &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Open Source')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Software')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Software')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt; (OSS) movement, and 
              potentially sponsored by the government during their &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Embryo')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Embryo')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;embryo&lt;/a&gt;nic phases. 
              The Open Source development community thrives on constant communication 
              and plentiful free advice. This behavior is common practice for 
              professional biology &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Hacker')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt;s, and it is already evident on the Web 
              amongst amateur biology hackers.&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; This represents an 
              opportunity to keep apprised of current research in a distributed 
              fashion. Anyone trying something new will require advice from peers 
              and may advertise at least some portion of the results of their 
              work. As is evident from the ready criticism leveled at miscreants 
              in online forums frequented by software developers (&lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Slashdot')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Slashdot')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, Kuro5hin, 
              etc.), people are not afraid to speak out when they feel the work 
              of a particular person or group is substandard or threatens the 
              public good. Thus our best potential defense against biological 
              threats is to create and maintain open networks of researchers at 
              every level, thereby magnifying the number of eyes and ears keeping 
              track of what is going on in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3) Because human intelligence gathering is, alas, demonstrably 
              inadequate for the task at hand, we should develop technology that 
              enables pervasive environmental monitoring. The best way to detect 
              biological threats is using biology itself, in the form of genetically 
              modified organisms. Unlike the production and deployment of chemical 
              weapons or fissile materials, which can often be monitored with 
              remote sensing technologies such as aerial and satellite reconnaissance, 
              the initial indication of biological threats may be only a few cells 
              or molecules. This small quantity may already be a lethal dose and 
              can be very hard to detect using physical means. Alternatively, 
              "surveillance bugs" distributed in the environment could transduce 
              small amounts of cells or molecules into signals measurable by remote 
              sensing. The organisms might be modified to reproduce in the presence 
              of certain signals, to change their schooling or flocking behavior, 
              or to alter their physical appearance. Candidate "detector platforms" 
              span the range of bacteria, &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Insect')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Insect')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;insect&lt;/a&gt;s, plants, and animals. Transgenic 
              zebrafish&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; and nematodes&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; have already been 
              produced for this purpose, and there is some progress in producing 
              a generalized system for detecting arbitrary molecules using signal 
              transduction pathways in bacteria.&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;None of these recommended goals will be trivial to accomplish. 
              Considerable sums have already been spent over the last five decades 
              to understand biological systems at the molecular level, much of 
              this in the name of defeating infectious disease. While this effort 
              has produced considerable advances in diagnosing and treating disease, 
              we should now redouble our efforts. We have entered an era when 
              the ability to modify biological systems is becoming widespread 
              in the absence of an attendant ability to remediate potential mistakes 
              or mischief. Maintaining safety and security in this context will 
              require concerted effort, and an immediate, focused governmental 
              R&amp;amp;D investment would be a good start. Although "&lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Bug')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Bug')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; to drug 
              in twenty four hours" sounds much flashier than "bug to drug in 
              six to eight weeks," the latter is the more realistic timeline to 
              shoot for&amp;#8212even if it is a decade or more away&amp;#8212and this 
              goal may serve as an organizational focus for an endeavor organized 
              and sponsored by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previous governmental efforts to rapidly develop technology, such 
              as the Manhattan and Apollo Projects, were predominantly closed, 
              arguably with good reason at the time. But we live in a different 
              era and should consider an open effort that takes advantage of preexisting 
              research and development networks. This strategy may result in more 
              robust, sustainable, distributed security and economic benefits.&lt;sup&gt;14,37&lt;/sup&gt; 
              Note also that though both were closed and centrally coordinated, 
              the Manhattan and Apollo Projects were very different in structure. 
              The Apollo Project took place in the public eye, with failures plainly 
              writ in smoke and debris in the sky. The Manhattan Project, on the 
              other hand, took place behind barbed wire and was so secret that 
              very few people within the US government and &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Military')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Military')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; knew of its 
              existence. This is not the ideal model for research that is explicitly 
              aimed at understanding how to modify biological systems. Above all 
              else, let us insist that this work happens in the light, subject 
              to the scrutiny of all who choose to examine it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The only way we will be able to keep track of the fruits of biological 
              technologies, regardless of merit, is a combination of ubiquitous 
              measurement and networks of people. For several decades, the Soviet 
              Union employed tens of thousands of people in research, testing, 
              and production of biological weapons.&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; During that time, 
              the USSR was the primary focus of intelligence agencies in the West, 
              and, despite the size of the Soviet bioweapons project, none of 
              those agencies was able to provide conclusive evidence of the project's 
              existence. The extent of biological weapons development and deployment 
              in Iraq during the early 1990's was also an unpleasant surprise.&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; 
              A more integrated worldwide community of professionals and amateurs 
              might provide earlier and more accurate warning of such developments. 
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beyond their innate intelligence gathering capability, open and 
              distributed networks of researchers would provide a flexible and 
              robust workforce for developing technology. This resource could 
              be employed in rapid reaction to emerging threats and in the development 
              of a response that might include assembling novel compounds or organisms. 
              The rudiments of such a system were demonstrated during the recent 
              SARS outbreak, but much more is required.&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; One lesson 
              from the OSS community is that even distributed technology development 
              that starts at the grass roots level eventually requires some centralized 
              leadership and coordination.&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; This is often provided 
              by a strong-willed individual, though increasingly independent foundations 
              are formed to coordinate work, gather and distribute funds, and 
              disseminate results.&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some may consider several decades of experience with open source 
              software insufficient as an organizational model to serve as a basis 
              for a response to biological threats. The best model may in fact 
              be found in the history of biology itself. In order to bring the 
              focus of an Apollo Project to the task at hand, the traditions of 
              open discourse amongst academics and the sharing of reagents and 
              biological stocks might be strengthened and adapted. Hoarding of 
              results or materials should be strongly discouraged, and in fact 
              sharing information and stocks should be required. It may be prudent 
              to write down these guidelines in documents with legal standing, 
              if only to give added weight to peer pressure. To be sure, this 
              might be viewed as a form of self-regulation, but it would be in 
              the context of open markets rather than black markets emerging under 
              regulation from above. These agreements might be structured so that 
              voluntary participation would provide ready access to information 
              or reagents otherwise difficult to procure, thereby encouraging 
              participation but not outlawing the activities of those who choose 
              to remain independent. New or existing foundations might take these 
              agreements in hand to provide coordination analogous to that cropping 
              up in the OSS community. There is already some structure of this 
              sort extant in the biological community, with organizations such 
              as the American Cancer Society, the Wellcome Trust, the Bill and 
              Melinda Gates Foundation, amongst many others, providing funding 
              for meetings, journals, physical infrastructure, and particular 
              directions of research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finally, the best argument for encouraging the adoption of Open 
              Source organizational principles in amateur, academic, and industrial 
              contexts is that the resulting technology may be considerably more 
              robust and bug free.&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt; This goal is nowhere more important 
              than in the burgeoning enterprise of manipulating &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Life')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Life')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; at the genetic 
              level. Creating international networks that coordinate an Open Source 
              Biology may be the most important step we can take to improve our 
              security in the coming decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Our ability to manipulate biological systems is rapidly improving 
              and this naturally raises concerns both about how relevant technology 
              will be applied and about potential consequent dangers. The straightforward 
              answer is that those dangers are real and considerable. We may view 
              this as a threat or an opportunity. The common response to a perceived 
              threat is to reduce the likelihood of it coming to fruition, an 
              effort that often takes the form of regulation. However, the argument 
              for strict regulation of biological technologies is misleading and 
              therefore dangerous. Fear of potential hazards should be met with 
              increased research and education rather than closing the door on 
              the profound positive impacts of biological technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We could err disastrously in the short term by restricting the 
              development of science and technology, thereby stunting our ability 
              to respond to natural or artificial threats. Restriction of research 
              could leave us woefully unprepared to deal with mistakes or mischief. 
              I am not suggesting that all regulation is without merit, but rather 
              that rules and restrictions will not eliminate problems; they never 
              have. Given the power of biological technologies, the only way to 
              ensure safety in the long run is to push research and development 
              as fast as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We should maintain an open environment as possible and make sure 
              that we move rapidly beyond the point where we can alter systems 
              without the ability to understand them or learn to fix them. Improving 
              such capabilities will also aid in diagnosing and treating rapidly 
              emerging natural pathogens. The existing technology lag between 
              our ability to manipulate and our ability to detect, understand, 
              and remediate must be eliminated with all haste. Regulation or proscription 
              of either science or technology is unlikely to ease the way forward. 
              In the dark we cannot see the road ahead, navigate, or avoid collisions 
              with either natural or artificial hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the outcome of the debate explored above, the stage 
              is set for remarkable change. We have clearly entered a period in 
              which our understanding of biological systems is itself producing 
              new biologically based technologies. These in turn lead to new insight 
              and new technologies, further enhancing our ability to understand 
              and manipulate biological systems. The demand for more capable technology 
              is both broad and deep suggesting that, as the trend to increasingly 
              sophisticated yet less expensive instrumentation continues, biological 
              technology will become ever more commoditized. The resulting wide 
              distribution will further accelerate discovery and &lt;a href="javascript:loadBrain('Invention')" onMouseOver="playBrain('Invention')" onMouseOut="stopBrain()" class="thought"&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td bgcolor=#DDDDDD colspan="4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliant article.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Really uplifting to read.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I wonder about the warning of einstein that or technology runs ahead of our wisdom to use it.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
He was commenting in the wake of the halocaust.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
it seems to me the pace has accelerated lately, and visions i was dicussing with my friends in london just 5 years ago and they then thought preposterous, are actually realities already, and chat shows like British television's 'the next big thing' not only discusses nanotechnology and AI techniques, but demonstrates  examples now built as a matter of course.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The radio is flodded with talk shows om new science and inventor scsintists have become celebrities as much as in Faraday's  or Edison's era.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
THE NEXT WAVE
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
- high wealth individuals will be able to buy life extension and body/brain/intelligence enhancement that is internal alteratin based.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Presently Americans are famous for having great teeth and somehow not aging despite low lycopine in their skins.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
It is of course surgery and chemicals etc and has all been bought.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
the first big wave of hyuman's effecting their own living evolution will be by people who can afford it.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
We debated this 15 years ago here and two groups veered:
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Those who thought being rich would give yoyu a great advantage;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Those who thought big change would happen very fast when it came and money would be no advantage.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
It must stike you with horror that you age.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
That you can do everything right and still wrinkle, sag and slow?
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
but within a short time it would be good to have a medical booth..a sort of regeneration chamber where the individual atoms of your body are realigned using non-invasive techniques such as ultra-sound.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If self-consciousness is the ability of a system to accurately model itself and understand it's make up, the  we are becoming much more self-conscsious by understanding how our bodies and minds work.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The biggest anti-aging stuff I've ever experienced was the famous  lef.org mix and also 5 grammes daily vitamin C.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I used to store samples of my DNA (and also anyone else's DNA I wanted to revive copies of usually girl-friends who'd ditched me when I said I wanted to be a philosopher), but I understood that with DNA synthesisers, then only a dream...it would be possible to build any human being body you wanted.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
dop you know if there's a FAST way of growing a cloned human?
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I heard of a technique that took just 16 weeks to maturity but cant trace it?
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
