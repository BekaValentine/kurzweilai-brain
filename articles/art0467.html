<p><i>Father of the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> Helped the Blind While 
              Reshaping <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">Information Technology</a> for the World</i></p>
<p>Palo Alto, Calif., May 16, 2002 -- Imagine enabling the blind to 
              "read" ordinary printed materials, along the way pioneering 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> technologies that profoundly impact how the world processes 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> for decades to come. </p>
<p>This is just the surface of the many amazing accomplishments of 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> of the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>, who 
              was announced today as an inductee into this year's class of <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a>s 
              to be honored by the National <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">Inventor</a>s Hall of Fame. The announcement 
              was made at a ceremony at <a class="thought" href="entries/hp_entry.html">Hewlett-Packard</a> Company, the leading <a class="thought" href="entries/corporate_entry.html">corporate</a> 
              sponsor of the National <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">Inventor</a>s Hall of Fame. </p>
<p>The Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> was the first <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> to transform 
              random text into <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>-spoken words, enabling blind and visually 
              impaired people to read any printed materials. When this first print-to-speech 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">reading machine</a> was invented in 1976, Kurzweil's <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> was 
              widely regarded as the most significant advancement for the blind 
              since Braille's introduction in 1829. It not only dramatically impacted 
              the lives of blind people (85 percent of blind college<br>
              students are estimated to have used one), it pioneered several <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> 
              technologies which have become separate industries that are still 
              thriving today. </p>
<p>The world was introduced to the <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> when Walter Cronkite 
              used it to close the evening news with "And that's the way 
              it is, January 13, 1976." For the first <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>, Cronkite did 
              not speak the words himself. Instead he had the <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> 
              deliver them.</p>
<p><a class="thought" href="entries/wonder_entry.html">Stevie Wonder</a> heard about the Kurzweil <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> that week, 
              and bought the first one. Kurzweil and Wonder developed a friendship 
              that would later evolve into the development of <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> 
              based on <a class="thought" href="entries/wonder_entry.html">Stevie Wonder</a>'s suggestions.</p>
<p>The <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a> is just one of many technologies resulting 
              from Kurzweil's expertise in <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>, and his innate 
              ability to envision the application of technologies far ahead of 
              the mainstream. In 1963, when he was just 15 years old, he wrote 
              his first <a class="thought" href="entries/mainframe_entry.html">mainframe</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> to help with his tedious summer 
              job of processing statistical results. <a class="thought" href="entries/ibm_entry.html">IBM</a> distributed the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> 
              to <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>ers everywhere. In high school, this son of an orchestra 
              conductor wondered why some <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> evoked <a class="thought" href="entries/emotion_entry.html">emotion</a>, and in 1965 Kurzweil 
              developed a <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that composed <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> to emulate the 
              compositions of famous composers such as Mozart. That <a class="thought" href="entries/invention_entry.html">invention</a> 
              won him first prize at the International <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Fair, a national 
              prize in the Westinghouse <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> Talent <a class="thought" href="entries/search_entry.html">Search</a>, and an appearance 
              on the game show "I've Got a Secret" with Steve Allen. 
              While a student at the Massachusetts Institute of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a>, he 
              wrote <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> to match high schoolers' interests with appropriate 
              colleges. The <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a>'s purchase by Harcourt Brace &amp; World funded 
              his college <a class="thought" href="entries/education_entry.html">education</a>. </p>
<p>A few years after graduating from MIT in 1970 with majors in <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>
<a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and literature, he formed a company to continue his interest 
              in developing <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, such as Optical Character 
              Recognition (<a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a>). He advanced the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> significantly by developing 
              the first omni-font <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> in 1974. Prior to Kurzweil's contribution, 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> could only read certain fonts with precise spacing 
              and in very high quality print. Kurzweil and his team developed 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> that understood the abstract qualities of letter shapes 
              and could read any font. The <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>, now called Xerox TextBridge, 
              is still marketed and developed 29 years after its initial development. 
            </p>
<p>Kurzweil developed <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> and other technologies before he had an 
              application for them through the <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>. He said, "I 
              really had a solution and was looking for a problem. Then, I happened 
              to sit next to a blind gentleman on a plane. He told me that he 
              traveled the world for his company, and that his blindness was a 
              characteristic, not a handicap. There was only one area in which 
              he was not able to match the abilities of sighted people: reading 
              ordinary printed materials. Only a small percentage of books was 
              translated to Braille, and there was a great lag between the <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a> 
              materials were published and translated." Kurzweil's omni-font 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/ocr_entry.html">OCR</a> gave all visually impaired people a solution for reading. </p>
<p>In developing the <a class="thought" href="entries/reading_machine_entry.html">Reading Machine</a>, Kurzweil also made major advancements 
              in scanning <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. He and his team developed the first Charge 
              Couple <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">Device</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ccd_entry.html">CCD</a>) flatbed scanner-the now-ubiquitous scanners 
              in our workplaces and homes. They also developed the first text-to-speech 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesis_entry.html">synthesis</a>. His advancements were at least a decade ahead of any 
              other similar introductions, and would eventually be used in applications 
              such as in-car <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a>s and phone response <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. </p>
<p>Other contributions include the <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_250_entry.html">Kurzweil 250</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/music_entry.html">music</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a>, 
              developed in 1984 after <a class="thought" href="entries/wonder_entry.html">Stevie Wonder</a> asked the <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> if he could 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er a <a class="thought" href="entries/synthesizer_entry.html">synthesizer</a> that could realistically recreate the rich 
              sounds of orchestral <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>s. Now every composer can have a 
              virtual orchestra at his or her fingertips. Also, Kurzweil invented 
              Kurzweil Voice Report, the first <a class="thought" href="entries/commercial_entry.html">commercial</a>ly marketed large vocabulary 
              speech recognition, a <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a> used by hands-impaired <a class="thought" href="entries/individual_entry.html">individual</a>s 
              and anyone who is unable to type at high speed. <br>
<br>
              Kurzweil has founded nine companies since his first one in 1973. 
              Today, FAT KAT (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil 
              Adaptive Technologies) uses <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a> to make stock market

              blind and the <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> disabled such as the dyslexic, visually impaired 
              and those <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> to read. </p>

              to passionately explore. He explained, "It turns out, the foundation 
              of <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> is not logical <a class="thought" href="entries/thinking_entry.html">thinking</a>, but <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. 
              We learn by recognizing previous relevant <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>s." Among 
              his writings on the topic of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> are the acclaimed 
              books, "The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_intelligent_machines_entry.html">Age of Intelligent Machines</a>" and "The

<p><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Raymond Kurzweil</a> has received many awards, in addition to ten honorary 
              doctorates and accolades from three U.S. presidents. He said, "Being
