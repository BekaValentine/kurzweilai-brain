              Kurzweil and Grossman&#8217;s approach to health and longevity combines 
              the most current and practical medical <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> with a soundly-based, 
              yet awe-inspiring <a class="thought" href="entries/visionary_entry.html">visionary</a> perspective of what&#8217;s to come.<br>
<br>
              Kurzweil&#8217;s <a class="thought" href="entries/philosophy_entry.html">philosophy</a> is built upon the premise that we now 
              have the knowledge to identify and correct the problems caused by 
              most unhealthy genetic predispositions. By taking advantage of the 
              opportunities afforded us by the genomic testing, nutritional supplements, 
              and lifestyle adjustments, we can live long enough to reap the benefits 
              of advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, which will ultimately 
              allow us to conquer aging and live forever. At the heart of Kurzweil&#8217;s 
              optimistic philosophy is the notion that <a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">human</a> knowledge is growing 
              exponentially, not <a class="thought" href="entries/linear_entry.html">linear</a>ly, and this fact is rarely taken into 
              account when people try to predict the rate of technological advance 
              in the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Kurzweil predicts that at the current rate of knowledge 
              expansion we&#8217;ll have the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> to completely conquer aging 
              within the next couple of decades.<br>

</i><i> </i> <i> I spoke with Ray on February 8, 2006. Ray speaks 
              very precisely, and he chooses his words carefully. He presents 
              his ideas with a lot of confidence, and I found his <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> to 
              be contagious. We spoke about the <a class="thought" href="entries/import_entry.html">import</a>ance of genomic testing, 
              some of the common misleading ideas that people have about health, 
              and how biotechnology and nanotechnology will radically affect our 
              longevity in the future.</i><br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What inspired your interest in life extension?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> Probably the first incident that got me on this path 
              was my father&#8217;s illness. This began when I was fifteen, and 
              he died seven years later of heart <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> when I was twenty-two. 
              He was fifty-eight. I&#8217;ll actually be fifty-eight this Sunday. 
              I sensed a dark cloud over my future, feeling like there was a good 
              chance that I had inherited his disposition to heart disease. When 
              I was thirty-five, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and the 
              conventional medical approach made it worse.<br>
<br>
              So I really approached the situation as an inventor, as a problem 
              to be solved. I immersed myself in the scientific literature, and 
              came up with an approach that allowed me to overcome my diabetes. 
              My levels became totally normal, and in the course of this process 
              I discovered that I did indeed have a disposition, for example, 
              to high cholesterol. My cholesterol was 280 and I also got that 
              down to around 130. That was twenty-two years ago.<br>
<br>
              I wrote a bestselling health book, which came out in 1993 about 
              that <a class="thought" href="entries/experience_entry.html">experience</a>, and the <a class="thought" href="entries/program_entry.html">program</a> that I&#8217;d come up with. That&#8217;s 
              what really got me on this path of realizing that&#8212;if you&#8217;re 
              aggressive enough about reprogramming your biochemistry&#8212;you can 
              find the ideas that can help you to overcome your genetic dispositions, 
              because they&#8217;re out there. They exist.<br>
<br>
              About seven years ago, after my book <i>The <a class="thought" href="entries/age_of_spiritual_machines_entry.html">Age of Spiritual Machines</a></i> 
              came out in 1999, I was at a <a class="thought" href="entries/foresight_institute_entry.html">Foresight Institute</a> conference. I met 
              Terry Grossman there, and we struck up a <a class="thought" href="entries/conversation_entry.html">conversation</a> about this 
              subject&#8212;nutrition and health. I went to see him at his longevity 
              clinic in Denver for an evaluation, and we built a friendship. We 
              started exchanging emails about health issues&#8212;and that was 10,000 
              emails ago. We wrote this book <i>Fantastic Voyage</i> together, 
              which really continues my quest. And he also has his own story about 
              how he developed similar ideas, and how we collaborated.<br>
<br>
              There&#8217;s really a lot of knowledge available right now, although, 
              previously, it has not been packaged in the same way that we did 
              it. We have the knowledge to reprogram our biochemistry to overcome 
              disease and aging processes. We can dramatically slow down aging, 
              and we can really overcome conditions such as atherosclerosis, that 
              leads to almost all heart attacks and strokes, diabetes, and we 
              can substantially reduce the risk of <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> with today&#8217;s knowledge. 
              And, as you saw from the book, all of that is just what we call 
              &#8216;Bridge One.&#8217; We&#8217;re not saying that taking lots of 
              supplements and changing your diet is going enable you to live five 
              hundred years. But it will enable Baby Boomers&#8212;like Dr. Grossman 
              and myself, and our contemporaries&#8212;to be in good shape ten or fifteen 
              years from now, when we really will have the full flowering of the 
              biotechnology revolution, which is &#8216;Bridge Two.&#8217;<br>
<br>
              Now, this gets into my whole theory of <a class="thought" href="entries/information_technology_entry.html">information technology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/biology_entry.html">Biology</a> 
              has become an information technology. It didn&#8217;t used to be. 
              Biology used to be hit or miss. We&#8217;d just find something that 
              happened to work. We didn&#8217;t really understand why it worked, 
              and, invariably, these tools, these drugs, had side-effects. They 
              were very crude tools. Drug development was called drug discovery, 
              because we really weren&#8217;t able to reprogram biology. That is 
              now changing. Our understanding of biology, and the ability to manipulate 
              it, is becoming an information technology. We&#8217;re understanding 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> processes that underlie disease processes, like 
              atherosclerosis, and we&#8217;re gaining the tools to reprogram those 
              processes.<br>
<br>
              Drug development is now entering an era of rational drug design, 
              rather than drug discovery. The important point to realize is that 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> is exponential, not linear. Invariably people&#8212;including 
              sophisticated people&#8212;do not take that into consideration, and it 
              makes all the difference in the world. The mainstream skeptics declared 
              the fifteen year <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a> project a failure after seven and half years 
              because only one percent of the project was done. The skeptics said, 
              I told you this wasn&#8217;t going to work&#8212;here you are halfway 
              through the project and you&#8217;ve hardly done anything. But the 
              progress was exponential, doubling every year, and the last seven 
              doublings go from one percent to a hundred percent. So the project 
              was done on <a class="thought" href="entries/time_entry.html">time</a>. It took fifteen years to sequence HIV. We sequenced 
              the SARS <a class="thought" href="entries/virus_entry.html">virus</a> in thirty-one days.<br>
<br>
              There are many other examples of that. We&#8217;ve gone from ten 
              dollars to sequence one base pair in 1990 to a penny today. So in 
              ten or fifteen years from now it&#8217;s going to be a very different 
              landscape. We really will have very powerful interventions, in the 
              form of rationally-designed drugs that can precisely reprogram our 
              biochemistry. We can do it to a large extent today with supplements 
              and nutrition, but it takes a more extensive effort. We&#8217;ll 
              have much more powerful tools fifteen years from, so I want it to 
              be in good shape at that time.<br>
<br>
              Most of my Baby Boomer contemporaries are completely oblivious of 
              this perspective. They just assume that aging is part of the cycle 
              of human life, and at 65 or 70 you start slowing down. Then at eighty 
              you&#8217;re dead. So they&#8217;re getting ready to retire, and are 
              really unaware of this perspective that things are going to be very 
              different ten or fifteen years from now. This insight really should 
              motivate them to be aggressive about using today&#8217;s knowledge. 
              Of course all of this will lead to &#8216;Bridge Three&#8217; about 
              twenty years from now&#8212;the nanotechnology revolution&#8212;where 
              we can go beyond the limitations of biology. We&#8217;ll have programmable 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>s that can keep us healthy from inside, and truly provide 
              truly radical life extension.<br>
<br>
              So that&#8217;s the genesis. My interest in life extension stems 
              primarily from my having been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. I 
              really consider the diabetes to be a blessing because it prodded 
              me to overcome it, and, in so doing, I realized that I didn&#8217;t 
              just have an approach for diabetes, but a general attitude and approach 
              to overcome any health problem, that we really can find the ideas 
              and apply them to overcome the genetic dispositions that we have. 
              There&#8217;s a common <a class="thought" href="entries/wisdom_entry.html">wisdom</a> that your genes are eighty percent 
              of your health and longevity and lifestyle is only twenty percent. 
              Well, that&#8217;s true if you follow the generally, watered-down 
              guidelines that our health institutions put out. But if you follow 
              the optimal guidelines that we talk about, you can really overcome 
              almost any genetic disposition. We do have the knowledge to do that.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What do you think are some of the common misleading 
              ideas that people have about health and longevity?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> One thing that I just eluded to is the compromised recommendations 
              from our health authorities. I just had a lengthy debate with the 
              Joslin Diabetes Center, which is considered the world&#8217;s leading 
              diabetes treatment and <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> center. I&#8217;m on the board, and 
              they&#8217;ve just come out with new nutritional guidelines, which 
              are highly compromised. They&#8217;re far from ideal, and they acknowledge 
              that. They say, well, we have enough trouble getting people to follow 
              these guidelines, let alone the stricter guidelines that you recommend. 
              And my reply is, you have trouble getting people to follow your 
              guidelines because they don&#8217;t work. If people followed your 
              guidelines very precisely they&#8217;d still have Type 2 diabetes. 
              They&#8217;d still have to take harsh drugs or insulin.<br>
<br>
              If they follow my guidelines the situation is quite different. I&#8217;ve 
              counseled many people about Type 2 diabetes, and Dr. Grossman has 
              treated many people with it, and they come back and they have completely 
              normal levels. Their symptoms are gone, and they don&#8217;t have 
              to take insulin or harsh drugs. They feel liberated, and that&#8217;s 
              extremely motivating. In many ways it&#8217;s easier to make a stricter 
              change. To dramatically reduce your high Glycemic index carbs is 
              actually easier than moderately reducing them, because if you moderately 
              reduce them you don&#8217;t get rid of the cravings for carbs. Carbs 
              are addictive, and it&#8217;s just like trying to cut down a little 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/bit_entry.html">bit</a> on cigarettes. It&#8217;s actually easier to cut cigarettes out 
              completely, and it&#8217;s also easier to largely cut out high Glycemic 
              index starches and sugars, because the cravings go away and it&#8217;s 
              much easier to follow. But, most importantly, it works along with 
              a few supplements and exercise to overcome most cases of Type 2 
              Diabetes.<br>
<br>
              However, this doesn&#8217;t seem to be the attitude our health authorities. 
              The nutritional recommendations are consistently compromised. There&#8217;s 
              almost no understanding of the role of nutritional supplements, 
              which can be very powerful. I take two hundred and fifty supplements 
              a day, and I monitor my body regularly. I&#8217;m not just flying 
              without <a class="thought" href="entries/instrument_entry.html">instrument</a>ation. Being an <a class="thought" href="entries/engine_entry.html">engine</a>er, I like <a class="thought" href="entries/data_entry.html">data</a> and I monitor 
              fifty or sixty different blood levels every few months, and I&#8217;m 
              constantly fine-tuning my program. All of my blood levels are ideal. 
              My Homocysteine level many years ago was eleven, but now it&#8217;s 
              five. My <a class="thought" href="entries/c_entry.html">C</a>-reactive <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a> is 0.1. My cholesterol is 130. My LDL 
              is about 60, and my HDL&#8212;which was 28&#8212;is now close to sixty. And 
              so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
              I&#8217;ve also taken <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> aging tests, which measure things 
              like tactile sensitivity, reaction time, <a class="thought" href="entries/memory_entry.html">memory</a>, and decision-making 
              speed. There are forty different tests, and you compare your score 
              to medians for different populations at different ages. When I was 
              forty I came out at about thirty-eight. Now I&#8217;m fifty-seven&#8212;at 
              least for a few more days&#8212;and I come out at forty. So, according 
              to these tests, I&#8217;ve only aged two years in the last seventeen 
              years. Now you can dispute the absolute validity of these biological 
              aging tests. It&#8217;s just a <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a>, but it&#8217;s just evidence 
              that this program is working.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> Why do you think that genomic testing is important?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> Our program is very much not a one size fits all. It&#8217;s 
              not a one-trick pony. We&#8217;re not saying that if you lower your 
              carbs, lower your fat, or eat a grapefruit a day then everything 
              will be fine. In fact, our publisher initially had a problem with 
              this, but they actually got behind it enthusiastically, because 
              it fundamentally differs, as you know, from most health books that 
              really do have just one idea. We earnestly try to provide a comprehensive 
              understanding of your biology and your body, which does have some 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/complexity_entry.html">complexity</a> to it. Then we let people apply these principles to their 
              own lives.<br>
<br>
              It is important to emphasize the issues that are concerns for yourself. 
              We use an <a class="thought" href="entries/analogy_entry.html">analogy</a> of stepping backwards towards a cliff. It&#8217;s 
              much easier to change direction before you fall off the cliff. But, 
              generally, medicine doesn&#8217;t get involved until the eruption 
              of clinical disease. Someone has a heart attack, or they develop 
              clinical cancer, and that&#8217;s very often akin to falling off 
              a cliff. One third of first heart attacks are fatal, and another 
              third cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.<br>
<br>
              It&#8217;s much easier to catch these conditions beforehand. You 
              don&#8217;t just catch heart disease or cancer walking down the street 
              one day. These are many years or decades in the making, and you 
              can see where you are in the progression of these diseases. So it&#8217;s 
              very important to know thyself, to <a class="thought" href="entries/access_entry.html">access</a> your own situation. Genetic 
              testing is important because you can see what dispositions you have. 
              If you have certain genes that dispose you to heart disease, or 
              conversely cancer, or diabetes, then you would give a higher priority 
              to managing those issues, and do more tests to see where you are 
              in the progression of those conditions. Let&#8217;s say you do a 
              test and it says you have a genetic disposition to Type 2 diabetes. 
              So you should do a glucose-tolerance test. In fact, we describe 
              a more sophisticated form of that in the book, where you measure 
              insulin as well, and can see if you have early stages of insulin 
              resistance.<br>
<br>
              Perhaps you have metabolic syndrome, which a very substantial fraction 
              of the population has. If you have these early harbingers of insulin 
              resistance, that could lead to Type 2 diabetes, so obviously the 
              priority of that issue will be greatly heightened. If you don&#8217;t 
              have that vulnerability then you don&#8217;t have to be as concerned 
              about insulin resistance, and so on. But if you do have insulin 
              resistance, or you have a high level of atherosclerosis, then it 
              really behooves you to take important steps to get these dangerous 
              conditions under control&#8212;which you can do. So genomic testing is 
              not something you do by itself. It&#8217;s part of a comprehensive 
              assessment program to know your own body&#8212;not only what you&#8217;re 
              predisposed to, but what your body has already developed in terms 
              of early versions of these degenerative conditions.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What are some of the most important nutritional supplements 
              that you would recommend to help prevent cancer and cardiovascular 
              disease?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> We spell all that out in the book. Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> 
              is important. It never ceases to amaze me that physicians do not 
              tell their patients to take coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> when they prescribe 
              Statin drugs. This is because it&#8217;s well known that Statin drugs 
              deplete the body of coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>, and a lot of the side-effects 
              such as muscle weakness that people suffer from Statin drugs are 
              because of this depletion of coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>. In any <a class="thought" href="entries/event_entry.html">event</a>, 
              that&#8217;s an important supplement. It is involved in <a class="thought" href="entries/energy_entry.html">energy</a> generation 
              within the <a class="thought" href="entries/mitochondria_entry.html">mitochondria</a> of each <a class="thought" href="entries/cell_entry.html">cell</a>. Disruption to the mitochondria 
              is an important aging process and this supplement will help slow 
              that down. Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> has a number of protective effect 
              including lowering blood pressure, helping to control free-radical 
              damage, and protecting the heart. <br>
<br>
              A lot of research recently shows the Curcumin, which is derived 
              from the spice turmeric, has important anti-inflammatory properties 
              and can protect against cancer, heart disease, and even Alzheimer&#8217;s 
              disease. <br>
<br>
              Alpha-Lipoic acid is an important antioxidant which is both water 
              and fat-soluble. It can neutralize harmful free radicals, improve 
              insulin sensitivity, and slow down the process of advanced Glycation 
              end products (AGEs), which is another key aging process. <br>
<br>
              Each of the vitamins is important and plays a key role. Vitamin 
              C is generally protective as a premier antioxidant. It appears to 
              have particular effectiveness in preventing the early stages of 
              atherosclerosis, namely the oxidizing of LDL cholesterol. <br>
<br>
              In terms of vitamin E, there&#8217;s been a lot of negative publicity 
              about that, but if you look carefully at that research you&#8217;ll 
              see that all of those studies were done with alpha-Tocopherol, and 
              vitamin E is really a blend of eight different substances&#8212;four 
              tocopherols and four Tocotrienols. Alpha-Tocopherol actually depletes 
              levels of gamma-Tocopherol, and gamma-Tocopherol is the form of 
              vitamin E that&#8217;s found naturally in food, and is a particularly 
              important one. So we recommend that people take a blend of the fractions 
              of vitamin E, and that they get enough gamma-Tocopherol.<br>
<br>
              There are a number of others that are important to take in general. 
              If you have high cholesterol, Policosanol is one supplement that 
              is quite effective, and has an independent <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a> from the Statin 
              drugs. Statin drugs actually are quite good. They appear to be anti-inflammatory, 
              so they not only lower cholesterol but attack the inflammatory processes, 
              which underlie many diseases, including atherosclerosis. But as 
              I mentioned it&#8217;s important to take coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> 
              if you&#8217;re taking Statin drugs.<br>
<br>
              There are others. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extract has been found 
              to be another effective antioxident. Resveratrol is another. We 
              have an extensive discussion of the most important supplements in 
              the book.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What sort of suggestions would you make to someone 
              who is looking to improve their memory or cognitive performance?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> Vinpocetine, derived from the periwinkle plant, seems 
              to have the best research. It improves cerebral blood flow, increases 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/brain_entry.html">brain</a> cell TP (energy) production, and enables better utilization 
              of glucose and <a class="thought" href="entries/oxygen_entry.html">oxygen</a> in the brain.<br>
<br>
              Other supplements that appear to be important for brain health include 
              Phosphatidylserine, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Pregneneolone, and EPA/DHA. 
              The research appears a bit mixed on Ginkgo Biloba, but we&#8217;re 
              not ready to give up on it. <br>
<br>
              We provide a discussion in the book of a number of smart nutrients 
              that appear to improve brain health. There are also a number of 
              smart drugs being developed, some of which are already in the testing 
              pipeline, that appear to be quite promising.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What do you think are the primary causes of aging?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> Aging is not one thing. There&#8217;s a number of different 
              processes involved and you can adopt programs that slow down each 
              of these. For example, one process involves the depletion of phosphatidylcholine 
              in the cell membrane. In young people the cell membrane is about 
              sixty or seventy percent phosphatidylcholine, and the cell membrane 
              functions very well then&#8212;letting nutrients in and letting toxins 
              out.<br>
<br>
              The body makes phosphatidylcholine, but very slowly, so over the 
              decades the phosphatidylcholine in the cell membrane depletes, and 
              the cell membrane gets filled in with inert substances, like hard 
              fats and cholesterol, that basically don&#8217;t work. This is one 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/reason_entry.html">reason</a>s that cells become brittle with age. The skin in an elderly 
              person begins to not be supple. The organs stop functioning efficiently. 
              So it&#8217;s actually a very important aging process, and you can 
              reverse that by supplementing with phosphatidylcholine. If you really 
              want to do it effectively you can take phosphatidylcholine intravenously, 
              as I do. Every week I have a I.V. with phosphatidylcholine. I also 
              take it every day orally. So that&#8217;s one aging process we can 
              stop today. <br>
<br>
              Another important aging process involves oxidation through positively-charged 
              oxygen free radicals, which will steal <a class="thought" href="entries/electron_entry.html">electron</a>s from cells, disrupting 
              normal enzymatic processes. There are a number of different types 
              of antioxidants that you can take to slow down that process, including 
              vitamin C. You could take vitamin C intravenously to boost that 
              process.<br>
<br>
              Advanced Glycation end-products, or AGEs, are involved in another 
              aging process. This is where proteins develop cross-links with each 
              other, therefore disrupting their function. There are supplements 
              that you can take, such as Alpha Lipoic Acid, that slow that down. 
              There is an <a class="thought" href="entries/experiment_entry.html">experiment</a>al drug called ALT-711 (phenacyldimenthylthiazolium 
              chloride) that can dissolve the AGE cross-links without damaging 
              the original tissues. <br>
<br>
              Atherosclerosis is an aging process, and it&#8217;s not just taking 
              place in the coronary arteries, of course. It can take place in 
              the cerebral arteries, which ultimately causes cerebral strokes, 
              but it also takes place in the arteries all throughout the body. 
              It can lead to impotence, claudication of the legs and limbs, and 
              like most of these processes, it&#8217;s not linear but exponential, 
              in that it grows by a certain percentage each year.<br>
<br>
              So that&#8217;s why the process of atherosclerosis hardly seems to 
              progress for a long time, but then when gets to a certain point 
              it can really explode and develop very quickly. We have an extensive 
              program on reducing atherosclerosis, which is both an aging process 
              and a disease process. We cite a number of important supplements 
              that reduce cholesterol and inflammation&#8212;such as the omega-3 fats 
              EPA and DHA&#8212;as well as the Statin drugs. Supplements like Curcumin 
              [Tumeric] are helpful. Supplements that reduce inflammation will 
              reduce both cancer and the inflammatory processes that lead to atherosclerosis. 
              There are a number of supplements that reduce Homocysteine, which 
              appears to encourage atherosclerosis. These include Folic Acid, 
              vitamins B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, and B<sub>12</sub>, magnesium, 
              and trimethylglycine (TMG). <br>
<br>
              So you can attack atherosclerosis five or six different ways, and 
              we recommend that you do them all, so long as there aren&#8217;t 
              contraindications for combining treatments. But generally these 
              treatments are independent of each other. If you go to war, you 
              don&#8217;t just send in the helicopters. You send in the helicopters, 
              the tanks, the planes, and the infantry. You use your <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> 
              resources, and attack the enemy every way that you can, with all 
              of your resources. And that&#8217;s really what you need to do with 
              these conditions, because they represent very threatening processes. 
              If you are sufficient proactive, you can generally get them under 
              control.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What are some of the new anti-aging treatments that 
              you foresee coming along in the near future, like from <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> 
              research and therapeutic cloning?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> It depends on what you mean by &#8220;near future,&#8221; 
              because in ten or fifteen years we foresee a fundamentally transformed 
              landscape.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> Let&#8217;s just say prior to nanotechnology, and then 
              that will be the next question.<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> is the next frontier is biotechnology. We&#8217;re really 
              now entering an era where we can reprogram biology. We&#8217;ve sequenced 
              the genome, and we are now reverse-engineering the genome. We&#8217;re 
              understanding the roles that the genes play, how they express themselves 
              in proteins, and how these proteins then play roles in sequences 
              of biochemical steps that lead to both orderly processes as well 
              as dysfunction&#8212;disease processes, such as atherosclerosis and 
              cancer&#8212;and we are gaining the means to reprogram those processes.<br>
<br>
              For example, we can now turn genes off with <a class="thought" href="entries/rna_entry.html">RNA</a> interference. This 
              is a new technique that just emerged a few years ago&#8212;a medication 
              with little pieces of RNA that latch on to the messenger RNA that 
              is expressing a targeted gene and destroys it, therefore preventing 
              the gene from expressing itself. This effectively turns the gene 
              off. So right away that <a class="thought" href="entries/method_entry.html">method</a>ology has lots of applications.<br>
<br>
              Take the fat insulin receptor gene. That gene basically says &#8216;hold 
              on to every <a class="thought" href="entries/calorie_entry.html">calorie</a> because the next hunting season may not work 
              out so well.&#8217; That was a good strategy, not only for humans, 
              but for most <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, thousands of years ago. It&#8217;s still probably 
              a good strategy for <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>s living in the wild. But we&#8217;re not 
              animals living in the wild. It was good for humans a thousand years 
              ago when calories were few and far between. Today it underlies an 
              epidemic of obesity. How about turning that gene off in the fat 
              cells? What would happen?<br>
<br>
              That was actually tried in mice, and these mice ate ravenously, 
              and they remained slim. They got the health benefits of being slim. 
              They didn&#8217;t get diabetes. They didn&#8217;t get heart disease. 
              They lived twenty percent longer. They got the benefits of caloric 
              restriction while doing the opposite. So turning off the fat insulin 
              receptor gene in fat cells is the idea. You don&#8217;t want to turn 
              it off in muscle cells, for example. This is one methodology that 
              could enable us to prevent obesity, and actually maintain an optimal 
              weight no <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> what we ate. So that&#8217;s one application of 
              RNA interference.<br>
<br>
              There&#8217;s a number of genes that have been identified that promote 
              atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes and many other diseases. We&#8217;d 
              like to selectively turn those genes off, and slow down or stop 
              these disease processes. There are certain genes that appear to 
              have an influence on the rate of aging. We can amplify the <a class="thought" href="entries/expression_entry.html">expression</a> 
              of genes similarly, and we can actually add new genetic information&#8212;that&#8217;s 
              gene therapy. Gene therapy has had problems in the past, because 
              we&#8217;ve had difficulty putting the genetic information in the 
              right place at the right <a class="thought" href="entries/chromosome_entry.html">chromosome</a>. There are new techniques now 
              that enable us to do that correctly.<br>
<br>
              For example, you can take a cell out of the body, insert the genetic 
              information in vitro&#8212;which is much easier to do in a Petri dish&#8212;and 
              examine whether or not the insertion went as intended. If it ended 
              up in the wrong place you discard it. You keep doing this until 
              you get it right. You can examine the cell and make sure that it 
              doesn&#8217;t have any <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a> errors. So then you take this now modified 
              cell&#8212;that has also been certified as being free of DNA errors&#8212;and 
              it&#8217;s replicated in the Petri dish, so that hundreds of millions 
              of copies of it are created. Then you inject these cells back into 
              the patient, and they will work their way into the right tissues. 
              A lung cell is not going to end up in the liver.<br>
<br>
              In fact, this was tried by a company I&#8217;m involved with, United 
              Therapeutics. I advise them and I&#8217;m on their board. They tried 
              this with a fatal disease called pulmonary hypertension, which is 
              a lung disease, and these modified cells ended up in the right place&#8212;in 
              the lungs&#8212;and actually cured pulmonary hypertension in animal tests. 
              It has now been approved for human trials. That&#8217;s just one 
              example of many of being able to actually add new genes. So we&#8217;ll 
              be able to subtract genes, over-express certain genes, under-express 
              genes, and add new genes.<br>
<br>
              Another methodology is cell transdifferentiation, a broader <a class="thought" href="entries/concept_entry.html">concept</a> 
              then just stem cells. One of the problems with stem cell research 
              or stem cell approaches is this. If I want to grow a new heart, 
              or maybe add new heart cells, because my heart has been damaged, 
              or if I need new pancreatic Islet cells because my pancreatic Islet 
              cells are destroyed, or need some other type of cells, I&#8217;d 
              like it to have my DNA. The ultimate stem cell promise, the holy 
              grail of these cell therapies, is to take my own skin cells and 
              reprogram them to be a different kind of cell. How do you do that? 
              Actually, all cells have the same DNA. What&#8217;s the difference 
              between a heart cell and pancreatic Islet cell?<br>
<br>
              Well, there are certain proteins, short RNA fragments, and peptides 
              that control gene expression. They tell the heart cells that only 
              the certain genes which should be expressed in a heart cell are 
              expressed. And we&#8217;re <a class="thought" href="entries/learning_entry.html">learning</a> how to manipulate which genes 
              are expressed. By adding certain proteins to the cell we can reprogram 
              a skin cell to be a heart cell or a pancreatic Islet cell. This 
              has been demonstrated in just the last couple years. So then we 
              can create in a Petri dish as many heart cells or pancreatic Islet 
              cells as I need, with my own DNA, because they&#8217;re derived from 
              my cells. Then inject them, and they&#8217;ll work their way into 
              the right tissues. In the process we can discard cells that have 
              DNA errors, so we can basically replenish our cells with DNA-corrected 
              cells.<br>
<br>
              While we are at it, we can also extend the <a class="thought" href="entries/telomere_entry.html">telomere</a>s. That&#8217;s 
              another aging process. As the cells replicate, these little repeating 
              codes of DNA called telomeres grow shorter. They&#8217;re like little 
              beads at the end of the DNA strands. One falls off every time the 
              cell replicates, and there&#8217;s only about fifty of them. So after 
              a certain number of replications the cell can&#8217;t replicate anymore. 
              There is actually one enzyme that controls this&#8212;telomerase, 
              which is capable of extending the telomeres. Cancer actually works 
              by creating telomerase to enable them to replicate without end. 
              Cancer cells become immortal because they can create telomerase.<br>
<br>
              As we&#8217;re rejuvenating our cells, turning a skin cell into a 
              kind of cell that I need, making sure that it has it&#8217;s DNA 
              corrected, we can also extend it&#8217;s telomeres by using telomerase 
              in the Petri dish. Then you got this new cell that&#8217;s just like 
              my heart cells were when I was twenty. Now you can replicate that, 
              and then inject it, and really rejuvenate all of the body&#8217;s 
              tissues with young versions of my cells. So that&#8217;s cell rejuvenation. 
              That&#8217;s one idea, or one technique, and there&#8217;s many different 
              variations of that.<br>
<br>
              Then there&#8217;s turning on and off enzymes. Enzymes are the work 
              horses of biology. Genes express themselves as enzymes, and the 
              enzymes actually go and do the work. And we can add enzymes. We 
              can turn enzymes off. One example of that is Torcetrapib, which 
              destroys one enzyme, and that enzyme destroys HDL, the good cholesterol 
              in the blood. So when people take Torcetrapib their HDL, good cholesterol 
              levels, soar, and atherosclerosis dramatically slows down or stops. 
              The phase 2 trials were very encouraging, and Pfizer is spending 
              a record one billion dollars on the phase 3 trials. That&#8217;s 
              just one example of many of these <a class="thought" href="entries/paradigm_entry.html">paradigm</a>: manipulating enzymes. 
              So there&#8217;s many different ideas to get in and very precisely 
              reprogram the information processes that underlie biology, to undercut 
              disease processes and aging processes, and move them towards healthy 
              rejuvenated processes.<br>

<b>David:</b> How do you see <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a>, 
              and nanotechnology affecting human health and life span in the future?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> I mentioned that we talk about three bridges to radical 
              life extension in <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>. Bridge One is aggressively 
              applying today&#8217;s knowledge, and that&#8217;s, of course, a moving 
              frontier, as we learn and gain more and more knowledge. In Chapter 
              10 of <i>Fantastic Voyage</i> I talk about my program, and at the 
              end I mention that one part of my program is what I call a positive 
              health slope, which means that my program is not fixed.<br>
<br>
              I spend a certain amount of time every week studying a number of 
              things&#8212;new research, new drug developments that are coming out, 
              new information about myself that may come from testing. Just reading 
              the literature I might discover something that&#8217;s in fact old 
              knowledge, but there&#8217;s so much information out there, I haven&#8217;t 
              read everything. So I&#8217;m constantly learning more about health 
              and medicine and my own body and modifying my own program. I probably 
              make some small change every week. That doesn&#8217;t mean my program 
              is unstable. My program is quite stable, but I&#8217;m fine-tuning 
              at the edges quite frequently.<br>
<br>
              Bridge Two we&#8217;ve just been talking about, which is the biotechnology 
              revolution. A very important insight that really changes one&#8217;s 
              perspective is to understand that progress is exponential and not 
              linear. So many sophisticated scientists fail to take this into 
              consideration. They just assume that the progress is going to continue 
              at the current pace, and they make this mistake over and over again. 
              If you consider the exponential pace of this process, ten or fifteen 
              years from now we will have really dramatic tools in the forms of 
              medications and cell therapies that can reprogram our health, within 
              the <a class="thought" href="entries/domain_entry.html">domain</a> of biology.<br>
<br>
              Bridge Three is nanotechnology. The golden era will be in about 
              twenty years from now. They&#8217;ll be some applications earlier, 
              but the real <a class="thought" href="entries/holy_grail_entry.html">Holy Grail</a> of nanotechnology are nanobots, blood cell-size 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a>s that can go inside the body and keep us healthy from inside. 
              If that sounds very <a class="thought" href="entries/futurist_entry.html">futurist</a>ic, I&#8217;d actually point out that 
              we&#8217;re doing sophisticated tasks already with blood cell-size 
              devices in animal experiments.<br>
<br>
              One scientist cured Type 1 diabetes in rats with a nano-engineered 
              capsule that has seven nanometers pores. It lets insulin out in 
              a controlled fashion and blocks antibodies. And that&#8217;s what 
              is feasible today. MIT has a project of a nano-engineered device 
              that&#8217;s actually smaller than a cell and it&#8217;s capable of 
              detecting specifically the antigens that exist only on certain types 
              of cancer cells. When it detects these antigens it latches onto 
              the cell, and burrows inside the cell. It can detect once it&#8217;s 
              inside and then at that point it releases a toxin which destroys 
              the cancer cell. This has actually worked in the Petri dish, but 
              that&#8217;s quite significant because there&#8217;s actually not 
              that much that could be different in vivo as in vitro.<br>
<br>
              This is a rather sophisticated device because it&#8217;s going through 
              these several different stages, and it can do all of these different 
              steps. It&#8217;s a nano-engineered device in that it is created 
              at the molecular level. So that&#8217;s what is feasible already. 
              If you consider what I call the <a class="thought" href="entries/law_of_accelerating_returns_entry.html">Law of Accelerating Returns</a>, which 
              is a doubling of the power of these information technologies every 
              year, within twenty-five years these <a class="thought" href="entries/computation_entry.html">computation</a>-<a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> technologies, 
              and our understanding of biology, will be a billion times more advanced 
              than it is today. We&#8217;re shrinking technology, according to 
              our models, at a rate of over a hundred per 3-D volume per decade.<br>
<br>
              So these technologies will be a hundred thousand times smaller than 
              they are today in twenty-five years, and a billion times more powerful. 
              And look at what we can already do today experimentally. Twenty-five 
              years from now these nanobots will be quite sophisticated. They&#8217;ll 
              have computers in them. They&#8217;ll have communication devices. 
              They&#8217;ll have small mechanical <a class="thought" href="entries/system_entry.html">system</a>s. They&#8217;ll really 
              be little robots, and they be able to go inside the body and keep 
              us healthy from inside. They will be able to augment the immune 
              system by destroying <a class="thought" href="entries/pathogen_entry.html">pathogen</a>s. They will repair DNA errors, remove 
              debris and reverse atherosclerosis. Whatever we don&#8217;t get around 
              to finishing with biotechnology, we&#8217;ll be able to finish the 
              job with these nano-engineered blood-cell sized robots or nanobots.<br>
<br>
              This really will provide radical life extension. The <a class="thought" href="entries/basic_entry.html">basic</a> metaphor 
              or analogy to keep in <a class="thought" href="entries/mind_entry.html">mind</a> is to ask the question, How long does 
              a house last? Aubrey de Grey uses this metaphor. The answer is, 
              a house lasts as long as you want it to. If you don&#8217;t take 
              care of it the house won&#8217;t last that long. It will fall apart. 
              The roof will spring a leak and the house will quickly decay. On 
              the other hand, if you&#8217;re diligent, and something goes wrong 
              in the house you fix it. Periodically you upgrade the technology. 
              You put in a new HVAC system and so forth. With this approach, the 
              house will go on indefinitely, and we do have houses, in fact, that 
              are thousands of years of old. So why doesn&#8217;t this apply to 
              the human body?<br>
<br>
              The answer is that we understand how a house works. We understand 
              how to fix a house. We understand all the problems a house can have, 
              because we&#8217;ve designed them. We don&#8217;t yet have that knowledge 
              and those tools today to do a comparable job with our body. We don&#8217;t 
              understand all the things that could wrong, and we don&#8217;t have 
              all the fixes for everything. But we will have this knowledge and 
              these tools. We will have complete models of biology. We&#8217;ll 
              reverse-engineered biology within twenty years, and we&#8217;ll have 
              the means to go in and repair all of the problems we have identified.<br>
<br>
              We&#8217;ll be able to indefinitely fix the things that go wrong. 
              We&#8217;ll have nanobots that can go in and proactively keep us 
              healthy at a cellular level, without waiting until major diseases 
              flare up, as well as stop and reverse aging processes. We&#8217;ll 
              get to a point where people will not age. So when we talk about 
              radical life extension we&#8217;re not talking about people growing 
              old and becoming what we think of today as a 95 year old and then 
              staying at a biological age 95 for hundreds of years.<br>
<br>
              We&#8217;re talking about people staying young and not aging. Actually, 
              I&#8217;m talking about even more than that, because in addition 
              to radical life extension, we&#8217;ll also have radical life expansion. 
              The nanobots will be able to go inside the brain and extend our 
              mental functioning by interacting with our biological <a class="thought" href="entries/neuron_entry.html">neuron</a>s. Today 
              we already have computers that are placed inside people&#8217;s brains, 
              that replace diseased parts of the brain, like the <a class="thought" href="entries/neural_implant_entry.html">neural implant</a> 
              for Parkinson&#8217;s disease. The latest generation of that implant 
              allows you <a class="thought" href="entries/download_entry.html">download</a> new software to your neural implant from outside 
              the patient&#8212;and that&#8217;s not an experiment, that&#8217;s an FDA 
              approved therapy.<br>
<br>
              Today these neural implants require surgery, but ultimately we&#8217;ll 
              be able to send these brain extenders into the nervous system noninvasively 
              through the capillaries of the brain, without surgery. And we&#8217;ll 
              be using them, not just to replace diseased tissue, but to go beyond 
              our current abilities&#8212;to extend our memories, extend our <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_entry.html">pattern</a> 
              recognition and cognitive capabilities, and <a class="thought" href="entries/merge_entry.html">merge</a> intimately with 
              our technology. So we&#8217;ll have radical life expansion along 
              with radical life extension. That&#8217;s my vision of what will 
              happen in the next several decades.<br>
<br>
<b>David:</b> What are you currently working on?<br>
<br>
<b>Ray:</b> I spend maybe forty or fifty percent of my time communicating&#8212;in 
              the form of books, articles, interviews, speeches. I give several 
              speeches a month. Then there&#8217;s my Web site: KurzweilAI.net. 
              We have a free daily or weekly newsletter; people can sign up by 
              putting in their <a class="thought" href="entries/email_entry.html">email</a> address (which is kept in confidence) on 
              the home page.<br>
<br>
              Then I have several businesses that I&#8217;m running, which are 
              in the area of <a class="thought" href="entries/pattern_recognition_entry.html">pattern recognition</a>. I&#8217;ve been in the reading 
              <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> business for thirty-two years. I developed the first print-to-speech 
              technology for the blind in 1976, and we&#8217;re introducing a new 
              version that fits in your pocket. A blind person can take it out 
              of their pocket, snap a picture of a handout at a meeting, a sign 
              on a wall, the back of a cereal box, an <a class="thought" href="entries/electronic_entry.html">electronic</a> display, and 
              the device will read it out loud to them through a earphone or speaker.<br>
<br>
              We&#8217;re developing a new medical technology, which is basically 
              a smart undershirt that monitors your health. There will be a smart 
              bra version for women. It takes a complete morphology EKG and monitors 
              your breathing. So, for example, if you&#8217;re a heart patient 
              it could tell you whether your atrial fibrillation is getting better 
              or worse. When you&#8217;re exercising it can tell you if you&#8217;re 
              getting a problem situation. So it gives you diagnostic information. 
              It can also alert you if you should contact your doctor. So basically 
              your undershirt is sending this information by <a class="thought" href="entries/bluetooth_entry.html">Bluetooth</a> to your 
              cell phone, and your cell phone is running this cardiac evaluation 
              software. So that&#8217;s another project.<br>
<br>
              Then we have Ray and Terry&#8217;s longevity products at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100613222854/http://rayandterry.com/" target="_blank">RayandTerry.com</a>, 
              which goes along with <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>. We have about 20 
              products available now, and we&#8217;ll have about fifty within a 
              few months. Basically all the things we recommend in the book will 
              be available. We also have combinations. So, for example, if you 
              want to lower cholesterol we have a cholesterol-lowering product, 
              and you don&#8217;t have to buy the eight or nine different supplements 
              separately. We put all of our recommendations together in one combination 
              to make it easy for people to follow. There&#8217;s a total daily 
              care, that has basic nutritional supplements, like vitamins and 
              minerals, and coenzyme Q-10, and so on. We have a meal-replacement 
              shake that is low carbohydrate, has no sugar, but actually tastes 
              good, which is actually very unique, because if you&#8217;ve ever 
              tasted a low-carb meal-replacement shake you know that there in 
              general the taste is not desirable. This might sound promotional 
              but that was the <a class="thought" href="entries/object_entry.html">object</a>ive, and it&#8217;s actually made up of the 
              nutritional supplements that we recommend. So that&#8217;s another 
              company, and those are the companies that we&#8217;re running.</p>

<br>
Wrong.
<br>
<br>
If there is an extreme fallacy regarding human rejuvenation, then this is it. You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT simply inject "young" versions of your cells and expect to grow progressively younger. Aging is NOT something you can "regenerate" away easily.
<br>
<br>
Aubrey De Grey, on the other hand, has identified just seven of the main causes of aging and has come up with a strategy for taking care of them all.
<br>
<br>
Once again Ray Kurzweil, our modern-day Howard Hughes, has failed to come up with a decent scientific theory of aging. He has taken short cuts and is presenting them to his audience. It should be recommended that Ray be given a good hard talking to by Aubrey De Grey.</p></td>
