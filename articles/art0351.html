<p>Briefing paper published prior to conference on November 19, 2001. Published on KurzweilAI.net November 8, 2001. See Ray <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080724165040/http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0358.html" target="_self">responses</a> to questions posed in this article.</p><h1>Briefing Paper</h1><h2><a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">PROGRESS</a> OVER PIETY?</h2><p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">Technology</a> and theology, <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> are often at odds. The struggle between an insatiable thirst for <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a> and an unwavering faith in <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a> has existed since humans first tasted the forbidden fruit in Eden. From <a class="thought" href="entries/galileo_entry.html">Galileo</a> to Darwin, the tension between scientists and theists has persisted throughout <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a>.</p>
<p>The debates over <a class="thought" href="entries/stem_cell_entry.html">stem cell</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>, cloning and abortion are but a few examples of the recent conflicts between moral purpose and scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. Far from being decided, the discourse over the meaning of life and the essence of humanity continues. And so, in the early dawn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we find ourselves weighing the benefits and detriments of technological advances.</p>

Nonetheless, Joy spurred a heated debate when he published an article suggesting, "Our most powerful 21<sup>st</sup>-century technologies -- <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>, genetic engineering, and <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotech</a> -- are threatening to make humans an endangered <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>."<sup>1</sup> In this treatise, he describes a <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> worthy of <a class="thought" href="entries/science_fiction_entry.html">science fiction</a> where humans are rendered extinct by a far-superior robot <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and the essence of <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> is irrevocably altered, both victims of our unbridled technological and scientific advances.</p>
<p>As he describes an encounter with author and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> at an industry conference, Joy introduces us to the prospect of humans fusing with robots, conjuring images of the Borg -- the part-human, part-<a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> warrior race that threatens the <a class="thought" href="entries/universe_entry.html">universe</a>--from an episode of <i>Star Trek</i> or, perhaps, "bionic" humans -- enhanced by <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> implants--as seen on the silver screen in <i>The </i><i>Terminator</i>. The vision is at once seductive and frightening.</p>
<p>Joy asks us to imagine that the impossible is possible. The human mind can be downloaded into a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a>. At last, humanity learns to cheat death, to achieve <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. The life everlasting is here on earth, not in heaven. All as a result of advances in genetic engineering, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> -- which Joy groups together as "<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>."</p>
<p>Genetic engineering, which is any human manipulation of the genetic code in the attempt to effect <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> improvement in a <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of plant or <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a>, has produced rose bushes that resist <a class="thought" href="entries/disease_entry.html">disease</a> and insects, which most gardeners welcome, as well as economically efficient genetically altered crops, which many consumers currently reject as "Frankenfoods."</p>
<p>Likewise, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, which is the art of manipulating materials on an atomic or molecular scale--especially to build microscopic devices (such as robots), holds the promise of enabling deaf people to hear. Thanks to <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a>, soon you will be able to swallow a camera instead of undergoing a colonoscopy.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">Robotics</a>--the <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> dealing with the design, construction, and <a class="thought" href="entries/operation_entry.html">operation</a> of robots in <a class="thought" href="entries/automation_entry.html">automation</a>--promises to make the futuristic fantasy of "servant" robots, which will clean the house, cook dinner and watch the kids, a <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a>.</p>
<p>Certainly, <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies will have a socioeconomic impact. However, the benefits of these technologies appear to justify continued advancement -- or do they?</p>
<p>Joy theorizes that genetic engineering, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a>) are so powerful that they surely will result in accidents and abuses that threaten both humanity and the very essence of life. "Most dangerously, for the first time, these accidents are widely within the reach of individuals or small groups. They will not require large facilities or rare raw materials. <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">Knowledge</a> alone will enable the use of them.</p>
<p> "Thus we have the possibility not just of weapons of mass destruction but of <a class="thought" href="entries/knowledge_entry.html">knowledge</a>-enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness hugely amplified by the power of <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a>."<sup>2</sup> In other words, the intelligent machines will run amok, proving to be uncontrollable, or, as Joy states, "A bomb is blown up only once -- but one bot can become many, and quickly get out of control."<sup>3</sup> (A bot is a robot or <a class="thought" href="entries/nanobot_entry.html">nanobot</a>. That is, a <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> or engineered <a class="thought" href="entries/entity_entry.html">entity</a>.)</p>
<p>If Joy's prospect of self-replicating intelligent machines has not sufficiently scared you, then genetic engineering should finish the job. "Genetic engineering promises to revolutionize agriculture by increasing crop yields while reducing the use of pesticides; to create tens of thousands of novel <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/bacteria_entry.html">bacteria</a>, plants, viruses, and animals; to replace reproduction, or supplement it, with cloning; to create cures for many diseases, increasing our life span and our quality of life; and much, much more. We now know with certainty that these profound changes in the <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> sciences are imminent and will challenge all our notions of what life is.</p>
<p> "Technologies such as human cloning have in particular raised our awareness of the profound ethical and moral issues we face. If, for example, we were to reengineer ourselves into several separate and unequal <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> using the power of genetic engineering, then we would threaten the notion of equality that is the very cornerstone of our democracy."<sup>4</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/bioterrorism_entry.html">Bioterrorism</a> looms large in Joy's pessimistic view of unchecked <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The same genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> that holds the promise of treating or even curing breast <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a>, diabetes and Alzheimer's may be used to create <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> weapons. The recent anthrax attacks and the threat of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> attacks using the smallpox virus are the primitive beginnings of Joy's apocalyptic vision. Imagine an anthrax bacterium that self-replicates when exposed to air is secretly turned loose on a major city. The technologically enhanced anthrax would reproduce itself and infect an untold <a class="thought" href="entries/number_entry.html">number</a> of unsuspecting people before authorities realize they are under attack. Humans would not stand a chance against the super-bugs.</p>
<p>Joy warns, "<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> has clear <a class="thought" href="entries/military_entry.html">military</a> and terrorist uses, and you need not be suicidal to release a massively destructive nanotechnological <a class="thought" href="entries/device_entry.html">device</a> -- such devices can be built to be selectively destructive, affecting, for example, only a certain geographical area or a group of people who are genetically distinct."<sup>5</sup>
</p>
<p>Plants do not fare any better than humans in the technologically advanced <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. Joys sees a world where genetically altered plants throw the entire ecosystem out of balance. (Frankenfoods overrun the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>.) Inedible plants with technologically enhanced leaves would overtake real plants. The earth would collapse under the weight of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. The world would cease to exist when the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> is finally destroyed by human inventions.</p>
<p>With reference to the experiences of the atomic scientists, Joy notes the need for today's scientists and technologists to take personal responsibility for the course of the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>. He invites us to slow down and evaluate the consequences of new technologies and scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>. Joy demands that we ask hard questions about the impact of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> on humanity. He even suggests that, ultimately, we may need to halt the wheels of <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a> and stop the quest for scientific advances so that humanity and life itself may simply continue to exist.</p><h3><a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a></h3><p>It is ironic that author and <a class="thought" href="entries/inventor_entry.html">inventor</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a> launched <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a> on his crusade against the dangers of <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies. From reading machines for the blind to music synthesizers, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>'s inventions seem to exemplify the promise of intelligent machines to improve life and to serve humanity.</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> believes that the <a class="thought" href="entries/evolution_entry.html">evolution</a> of smart machines will run a natural course. "The emergence of <a class="thought" href="entries/machine_entry.html">machine</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> that exceeds human <a class="thought" href="entries/intelligence_entry.html">intelligence</a> in all of its broad <a class="thought" href="entries/diversity_entry.html">diversity</a> is inevitable."<sup>6</sup> Rather than fear it, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> embraces the new technologies and their promise.</p>
<p>According to <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a>, there is an adjustment period to new technologies. "People often go through three stages in examining the impact of <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>: awe and wonderment at its potential to overcome age-old problems, a sense of dread at a new set of grave dangers that accompany these new technologies, followed, finally and hopefully, by the realization that the only viable and responsible path is to set a careful course that can realize the promise while managing the peril."<sup>7</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> and Joy apparently share a belief in the potential power of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> even admits that Joy's concerns over abuses of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> are sound and reasonable. The two men differ on the remedy. While Joy suggests that we may need to abandon some technological pursuits for humanity's sake, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> argues that humanitarian concerns require the vigorous advancement of technologies.</p>
<p> "<a class="thought" href="entries/human_entry.html">Human</a> suffering continues and demands our steadfast attention. Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies might one day be used for malevolent purposes? That should be a rhetorical question. Yet, there is a movement to do exactly that. Most people, I believe, would agree that such broad-based <a class="thought" href="entries/relinquishment_entry.html">relinquishment</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development is not the answer."<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p>The two men also share a concern over the relationship between <a class="thought" href="entries/terrorism_entry.html">terrorism</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a>. While Joy focuses on the potential abuses of technological advances by terrorists, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> fears that the curtailment of technological <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a> and development will create black market <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> enterprises.</p>
<p> "Abandonment of broad areas of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> will only push these technologies underground where development would continue unimpeded by <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> or regulation. In such a situation, less stable, less responsible practitioners--for example, terrorists--would have a monopoly on deadly expertise."<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> believes that it would be economic suicide to substantially slow or stop technological advancement.</p>
<p>Despite his enthusiasm for technological <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> supports what he calls "fine-grained relinquishments" like a moratorium on the development of physical entities that can self-replicate in a natural environment, a ban on self-replicating physical entities that contain their own codes for <a class="thought" href="entries/self_replication_entry.html">self-replication</a> and a design called "<a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">Broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">Architecture</a>," which would require entities to obtain self-replicating codes from a centralized secure <a class="thought" href="entries/server_entry.html">server</a> that would guard against undesirable replication.</p>
<p>Noting that "nanobots" can be stronger and smarter than <a class="thought" href="entries/protein_entry.html">protein</a>-based entities, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> points to <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">Broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">Architecture</a> as one way in which <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> can be made safer than <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> foresees the combination of the two technologies with <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> providing the codes within <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> entities (replacing <a class="thought" href="entries/dna_entry.html">DNA</a>), and utilizing <a class="thought" href="entries/broadcast_entry.html">Broadcast</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/architecture_entry.html">Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>In his view, the benefits of new technologies far outweigh the risks. <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> seems to have a relentless <a class="thought" href="entries/optimism_entry.html">optimism</a> about the ability of technologists and scientists to address any ill effects. He uses the example of <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses to demonstrate this point. "Although destructive, self-replicating <a class="thought" href="entries/software_entry.html">software</a> entities [<a class="thought" href="entries/computer_entry.html">computer</a> viruses] do cause damage from time to time, the injury is but a small fraction--much less than one-tenth of 1 percent--of the benefit we receive from the computers and <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> links that harbor them."<sup>10</sup>
</p>
<p>At times, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> seems to be at odds with his own prophecy. While predicting that, by the year 2099, intelligent beings will no longer view life expectancy as a viable term, <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> also questions what meaning life can have without death. "We make extraordinary efforts to delay [death,] and indeed often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet we would find it hard to live without it. <a class="thought" href="entries/death_entry.html">Death</a> gives meaning to our lives."<sup>11</sup>
</p>
<p>But <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> quickly discards his doubts as he dreams of human <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>. "The human <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>, along with the computational <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> it created, will be able to solve age-old problems of need, if not desire, and will be in a position to change the <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/mortality_entry.html">mortality</a> in a post-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> world."<sup>12</sup>
</p>
<p>It seems both <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Kurzweil</a> and Joy agree that, left unfettered, technologists and scientists will transform this <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a> into a world we can barely imagine, one in which the very essence of life and humanity will be redefined.</p><h3><a class="thought" href="entries/foerst_entry.html">Anne Foerst</a></h3><p>As a theologian, Lutheran minister and visiting professor for Theology and <a class="thought" href="entries/computer_science_entry.html">Computer</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">Science</a> at St. Bonaventure University, <a class="thought" href="entries/foerst_entry.html">Anne Foerst</a> is trying to foster a dialog between theologians and scientists and technologists, especially <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> (<a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>) researchers. She seeks to reconcile supporters and opponents of <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> because of her certainty that both camps have unique contributions to make to the process of technological advancement.</p>
<p> "Theology cannot give any answer about how the brain might work and which mechanistic correlations there are in ourselves. <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>, on the other hand, cannot give any answer about meaning of life and cannot support humans in their intuitive understanding of themselves and within their struggles with their ambiguous and fearful life.</p>
<p> "The Courage to Doubt of theologians, therefore, can lead both, people from the <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a>-camp and people from the theological camp to create all together, a common perspective on <a class="thought" href="entries/reality_entry.html">reality</a> in which both sides play their own, important part!"<sup>13</sup>
</p>
<p>Foerst recently served as the theological advisor for two <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">artificial intelligence</a> projects at M.I.T. When asked by a reporter why a theologian belonged in an <a class="thought" href="entries/ai_entry.html">AI</a> laboratory, Foerst gave two reasons. First of all, she noted that theologians study cultural and spiritual dimensions of human beings -- <a class="thought" href="entries/information_entry.html">information</a> that should prove invaluable to those who construct <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> machines.</p>
<p>Secondly, with the development of smart machines come ethical questions about how humans will treat such machines, and how those machines might one day treat humans. Foerst explains that, ultimately, humans will have to decide when and if the <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> machines should be treated as intrinsically valuable.<sup>14</sup>
</p>
<p>Foerst also has commented on the ethical issues surrounding human genetic engineering, especially as they relate to the <a class="thought" href="entries/human_genome_entry.html">human genome project</a>. "The question of what makes an ideal human being arises--what would be the standards to measure a perfect human? That, of course, leads to the question of acceptance of a person... Will I be accepted only when I'm perfect, or can I be accepted if I have Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) because my parents decided not to have a genetic test?</p>
<p> "These are the crucial questions of the whole genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/research_entry.html">research</a>. And, of course, as a consequence of that, who actually has the power to decide what it means to be 'normal'?"<sup>15</sup>
</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Foerst invites us to examine the ultimate goals of technological advancement. She asks if we really want to eradicate every human defect. And she ponders whether, in the end, <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a> will be richer.</p>
<p> "When we think about certain mental impairments such as depression or bipolarity, which seem to have a genetic <a class="thought" href="entries/component_entry.html">component</a>, do we actually want to get rid of them, even if people with these illnesses are often enormously creative? For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a> Mozart has been diagnosed to be very likely bipolar."<sup>16</sup> Given that the thin line between <a class="thought" href="entries/genius_entry.html">genius</a> and insanity has been long acknowledged, Foerst challenges us to assess the full impact of genetic engineering. When the genetic engineers decide what it means to be a perfect human, what will humanity have lost? And who will make those decisions?</p>
<p>As a theologian, Foerst also examines technological advances as they relate to <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>. She observes that humans, who were created in the image of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>, have intrinsic values, regardless of our defects. And Foerst notes that, "[e]ven if we have decoded now, or mapped, 90 percent of the <a class="thought" href="entries/genome_entry.html">genome</a>, it doesn't tell us anything about the dignity of human beings.<sup>17</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, Foerst encourages the public to be ever vigilant as technologists and scientists continue their work. She warns that if we place <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> over <a class="thought" href="entries/conscience_entry.html">conscience</a>, we may risk our own humanity. "The danger I see in some of the overstated claims is that people will say, 'Oh, humans are nothing but their genes,' and that they give <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a> universal power over who they are and say that <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> has no place. But I think that only we all together can come to an understanding of what it means to be a person."<sup>18</sup>
</p><h3>Bill McKibben</h3><p> "In the blink of an eye, and with hardly a <a class="thought" href="entries/thought_entry.html">thought</a>, our <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> has come to the verge of dominating everything that happens on the surface of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>,"<sup>19</sup> declared environmentalist and author Bill McKibben in his article "Humans Supplant <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>; Everything Changes." From <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> to genetic manipulation, McKibben warns that humanity is on a collision course with <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a> -- and this is the precise moment in time when humans can change the course.</p>
<p>McKibben compares this time in <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> to the Civil Rights movement of his parents' time, the Second World War of their parents and the Civil War of their parents. In other words this moment in time when "humans supplant <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>; everything changes" is big news -- but too few are talking about it. McKibben is critical of academics, bioethicists, the media and everyone who has failed to adequately take notice of stunning technological and scientific advances.</p>
<p>McKibben, who was among the first to warn of greenhouse gases and <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> in his book <i>The End of </i><i>Nature</i> back in 1989, notes with great alarm that the oceans are rising as the glaciers melt, severe storms are increasing and animals are altering their migration patterns -- "all caused by the habits and appetites of one <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a>."<sup>20</sup> He also warns that the <a class="thought" href="entries/growth_entry.html">growth</a> of genetic manipulation, "from a small corner of the scientific enterprise to the very clear center of economic life,"<sup>21</sup> may threaten the very essence of life, as we know it.</p>
<p>In 1989, McKibben also commented about the potential dangers of genetic engineering, a <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> then in its infancy. "In the intervening years, this <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> has spread like wildfire, to the point where 40 percent of our nation's fields grow genetically engineered crops, where <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> after <a class="thought" href="entries/animal_entry.html">animal</a> has been cloned; where everyone who thinks about it realizes it is only a <a class="thought" href="entries/matter_entry.html">matter</a> of time, and likely a very short time, before we do likewise and more with human beings. As thresholds go, this is a large one-as different from conventional plant breeding, say, as <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> is from smog over Los Angeles."<sup>22</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">Nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a> raise far-reaching concerns for McKibben. His dim view of unchecked <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> includes a "post-human" world that McKibben imagines "might well be a world beyond <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a>, beyond delight, beyond morality or even <a class="thought" href="entries/communication_entry.html">communication</a> beyond a set of coded rules and instructions."<sup>23</sup> McKibben predicts that life on an environmentally ravaged, technologically advanced earth in the not-so-distant-<a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> may "be as spiritually and emotionally barren as that overheated world may be biologically barren."<sup>24</sup>
</p>
<p>Critical of what he labels "the frog-in-the-heating-pot" school of environmental philosophers and historians who chalk up human-induced changes in the environment as a natural byproduct of human <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>, McKibben urges that it is time to take <a class="thought" href="entries/action_entry.html">action</a>. "My point is that we need to recognize the magnitude of the changes now under way. And if we are intellectually serious, morally serious, we need to engage in far more soul-searching than we've done so far about whether they make sense or not."<sup>25</sup>
</p>
<p>McKibben sounds a clarion call for the transformation of the environmental movement -- in his view, the necessary next step in the effort to save the earth. He warns the environmentalism must shift from its traditional "concern with preventing degradation to <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">nature</a>" to a new focus on preventing gratuitous technological and scientific improvements that threaten life, as we know it. "Whether we will still call it environmentalism, and whether it will draw its strength from the same places, is open to question. But the animating <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">spirit</a> will need to be a love for the world we were born into, both the physical world and the web of relationships, human and otherwise, that still survive here."<sup>26</sup>
</p>
<p>McKibben suggests some <a class="thought" href="entries/common_sense_entry.html">common sense</a> limits on technological and scientific advances. For <a class="thought" href="entries/instance_entry.html">instance</a>, he proposes that we might limit genetic manipulation to certain human health problems, respect the integrity of other <a class="thought" href="entries/species_entry.html">species</a> and lessen our impact on the earth's climate. But he does not stop there.</p>
<p>In what must amount to heresy in the tech world and scientific circles, McKibben exhorts "environmentalists must now grapple squarely with the idea of a world that has enough <a class="thought" href="entries/wealth_entry.html">wealth</a> and enough technological capability, and should not pursue more. Enough is a deeply subversive idea, but a deeply resonant one as well--it echoes the ideas to which we pay lip service weekly in a million churches and mosques and synagogues."<sup>27</sup>
</p>
<p>While McKibben marvels at how well the scientific process works, he points out that other disciplines have not kept pace. And he sounds a chill warning that our "domination may carry the seeds of our own diminution. The forces we unleash by raising the temperature -- and quite possibly the forces we unleash with what is essentially reckless genetic tinkering -- may be so strong that they may overwhelm us."<sup>28</sup>
</p>
<p>He also notes that our desire for unlimited life seems to be the ultimate goal fueling the drive for technological and scientific advances. McKibben characterizes technologists and scientists as intent upon cheating death. "[I]t is clear that these revolutionary technologies are being driven by people with <a class="thought" href="entries/immortality_entry.html">immortality</a>, or something very near it, on their minds."<sup>29</sup>
</p>
<p> "Hence, for those of us who believe the world to be a sweet place as presently constituted, this is a moment of enormous danger: we live on the brink of a great forgetting."<sup>30</sup>

</table><h3>Topics:</h3><p>It would be impossible to cover the <a class="thought" href="entries/ethics_entry.html">ethics</a> of <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> in one panel discussion. So, we must limit the topics we cover. Hence, in keeping with the mission of Washington National Cathedral, we will focus our discussion on the following:</p>
<p>1) The dangers--moral, ethical and physical--of technological and scientific advances (specifically genetic engineering, <a class="thought" href="entries/nanotechnology_entry.html">nanotechnology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/robotics_entry.html">robotics</a>) to humanity and the environment.</p>
<p>2) The prospective benefits and enhancements of technological and scientific <a class="thought" href="entries/progress_entry.html">progress</a>.</p>
<p>3) The role of <a class="thought" href="entries/religion_entry.html">religion</a> and theology in setting ethical and moral guidelines for <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>4) The spiritual meaning behind these advances and the <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> they will create.</p><h2>Suggested Questions:</h2><h3>To <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>:</h3><p>Does the threat of abuse mean that we should suspend all genetic engineering, including promising therapies for <a class="thought" href="entries/cancer_entry.html">cancer</a> and other human diseases? If not, how do we determine where to draw the line in technological advances?</p>
<p>What technological advance do you see as holding the greatest threat to humanity if abused by terrorists?</p>
<p>Isn't it also possible that technological advances can somehow help to deter <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> threats to humanity?</p><h3>To <a class="thought" href="entries/kurzweil_entry.html">Ray Kurzweil</a>:</h3><p>If the quest for new technological advances is inevitable, as you seem to suggest, how can we prevent the <a class="thought" href="entries/dystopian_entry.html">dystopian</a> <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a> predicted by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>?</p>
<p>Given humanity's track record with chemical and <a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> weapons, are we not guaranteed that terrorists and/or malevolent governments will abuse <a class="thought" href="entries/gnr_entry.html">GNR</a> technologies? If so, how do we address this problem without an outright ban on the technologies?</p>
<p>Isn't it true that both the technological and scientific fields lack broad participation by women, lower socioeconomic classes and sexual and ethnic minorities? If so, shouldn't we be concerned about the missing voices? What impact does the narrowly defined demographic have on <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> and <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>?</p>
<p>How do you view the intrinsic worth of a "post-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a>" world?</p><h3>To <a class="thought" href="entries/foerst_entry.html">Anne Foerst</a>:</h3><p>As scientists and technologists tinker with the very building blocks of creation, are humans playing <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>?</p>
<p>When will <a class="thought" href="entries/humanoid_entry.html">humanoid</a> machines become human, and how will we incorporate them into our <a class="thought" href="entries/society_entry.html">society</a>? Will they have rights under the law? Will they worship <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>?</p>
<p>How does a doctrine like creation theology accommodate or address the concerns raised by <a class="thought" href="entries/joy_entry.html">Bill Joy</a>? Is this new <a class="thought" href="entries/technology_entry.html">technology</a> part of <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s creation? If so, what does that say about our stewardship of this new form of creation? Given humankind's <a class="thought" href="entries/history_entry.html">history</a> of abusing <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s creation, will these new technologies lead us to an apocalyptic <a class="thought" href="entries/future_entry.html">future</a>?</p><h3>To Bill McKibben:</h3><p>What are the signals that time is running out? Is it too late to undo the damage we have done to the earth? How can we prevent further damage?</p>
<p>What ethical guidelines should be imposed to protect against the further degradation of the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>?</p>
<p>Is a post-<a class="thought" href="entries/biological_entry.html">biological</a> world one worth living in from a spiritual perspective?</p><h2>Panelists:</h2><p>

<p>
<b>Bill McKibben</b>, environmentalist, author and activist, spurred an international debate when he detailed the onset of the greenhouse effect in his 1989 bestseller, <u>The End of </u><u>Nature</u>. Labeled an "environmental wacko" by Rush Limbaugh, McKibben's theory initially was dismissed by many. Today, his theory--that humans are irrevocably changing the climate and all life on the <a class="thought" href="entries/planet_entry.html">planet</a>--is now widely accepted <a class="thought" href="entries/science_entry.html">science</a>.</p>
<p>McKibben was a fellow at the Harvard Divinity School's Center for the Study of Values in Public <a class="thought" href="entries/life_entry.html">Life</a>, where he investigated "what is means to be heirs to <a class="thought" href="entries/god_entry.html">God</a>'s increasingly damaged creation and how people of faith can respond to the <a class="thought" href="entries/global_warming_entry.html">global warming</a> crisis."<sup>31</sup> McKibben believes that communities of faith must play a pivotal role in the debate around questions of human <a class="thought" href="entries/identity_entry.html">identity</a> and human justice.<sup>32</sup>
</p>
<p>A former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine, McKibben's other books on the environment and ethical living include <u>Hundred Dollar Holiday</u>, <u>Maybe One</u>, <u>The Age of Missing </u><u>Information</u> and <u>Hope, </u><u>Human</u><u> and Wild</u>.</p>
<p>Winner of the 2000 Lannan Prize for Nonfiction Writing, McKibben is a frequent contributor to a variety of publications, including <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>. McKibben was honored with an award from the Ripton-based <a class="thought" href="entries/spirit_entry.html">Spirit</a> in <a class="thought" href="entries/nature_entry.html">Nature</a> organization, and received a Bicentennial medal from Middlebury College in the fall of 2000. He currently is a visiting scholar at Middlebury College. While at Middlebury, he will work on a new book about the environmental implications of <a class="thought" href="entries/biotechnology_entry.html">biotechnology</a>.</p>
<p>McKibben lives with his wife and daughter in Middlebury, Vermont, and he is a Sunday school teacher at a Methodist church.</p>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>Bill Joy reminds me of the typical successful American who, once he has found riches for himself wants to do everything he can to turn around and shut the door to any more new-comers. How would he accomplish that? By closing the door to the kinds of technological advances that hold the possibility of making poverty a thing of the past, and bringing a humane life style to the masses of people, half of whom worldwide still live at the edge of civilization -- in abject poverty, a paycheck or harvest away from starvation.
<br>
<br>
He represents the kind of immoral attitude that runs rampant in this, the richest country in the world, that also has the widest gap between the rich and everyone else. We should be dismissing his ideas out of hand, realizing that they are self-serving. Rich people rarely want to see real advances in the average and bottom-line standard of living, because they enjoy the contrast of being so rich, surrounded by so much poverty. After all, "what is the use of riches if they don't somehow set one apart from the common riff-raff," these types of callused people think to themselves.
<br>
We live in a society of great contridictions: the contrast between the lifestyles of the Bill Joys of the world and the other half, the poor half, are just the tip of the iceberg. The one I find the most striking is the contrast between the good that our scientists and technologists do in advancing the general state of the people of the world, compared to the bad that the owners of capital, like Bill Joy, do with their economic system that thrives on poverty and abhors scientific advance, even as it is pushed into such advance by its own need for competition.
<br>
<br>
Bill Joy, and all of his class of careless limo-liberals should really step out of the way and let progress continue!
<br>
<br>

This is fact the case! I can't say that for American billionaires, but I do observe this in a much lesser scale (lesser in money terms) in my country.
<br>
<br>
Many doctors, judges merchants and others from the so called upper class advocates the freezing of everything in the name of environmental conservation - anything what could serve them in this 'contrast pursue'.
<br>
<br>
To have a RELATIVELY better position than any other - to close the door behind - is a very important characteristic of many humans.

What is very understandable from the evolutionary point of view, but to be despised by (trans)humanists.

<br>
<br>
You've begun to understand - that is!
<br>
<br>
&gt; Do you really believe in the evil rich - noble poor dichotomy? 
<br>
<br>
It's a silly theory! In fact - evil poor and noble rich is more likely. Due to the fact, rich is better informed. Could more often see broader.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Also, can you explain why environmental conservation would benefit the rich?
<br>
<br>
I like the clean environment. I don't like greens however. Be cause they do just the opposite of what should be done.
<br>
<br>
In your country (USA - isn't it?) they were quite successful in closing down the nuclear energy program. For example.
<br>
<br>
Rich and the environment?
<br>
<br>
If you mean the rich in my country - I have to explain. 
<br>
<br>
The richest one here (among 2 millions) has less than 10 million US dollars. (But on the other hand, 85% _owns_ (or their family member)  house or flat - the highest rate in the whole world - and the quality is quite high). The average consumer spending is approximately the same as in Canada.
<br>
<br>
So, those who are "rich" here generally tends to have very aristocratic conservative views. The narcissism of a small difference is manifested many ways. Environmentalism is popular just to freeze everything as is. Not to dynamic the society. To prevent the up down mobility, to have (at least small) contrast, to have a rank secured for thousands of years - if possible.
<br>
<br>
The "poor"? They are even worse. Waiting to replace the elite in a communist revolution.
<br>
<br>
Both in fact dislike what is coming. Too ignorant they are. 
<br>
<br>
The boring human's game - your grandchildren should be servants of mine - eclipses everything. The Billy Joy's "concerns" - is just a way to play it. Green's agenda to take cars from others - is another. Closing the door behind - is yet another.

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>This rich/poor dichotomy is mostly an illusion.  We live in a mobile society where the poor have a chance to become rich and the rich are often in that position for a relatively short time.  How is this great wealth held by most of these rich people?  I think you'll find that their wealth is in the form of stocks and bonds and that wealth is illusory.  
<br>
<br>
Bill Gates, for example, lost half his wealth in one swoop this year when the stock market fell.  Although he still had plenty left when it was over, there were hundreds of newly rich in silicon valley who lost everything they owned.
<br>
<br>
Most of that so-called wealth is tied up in factories and businesses.  When those businesses go out of business, the wealth evaporates.  People whose wealth was placed in the air travel industry, for example, are going from rich to indebted at a rate never seen before.  
<br>
<br>
Nobody puts much of their money in a 2% bank account and just sits on it.  You can't get or stay rich that way.  You get rich by risking your money on things with a bigger payoff.  Unfortunately, you lose your money the same way.  So in times of change, the rich become poor again and the poor find ways to get rich.  Which side of the line you're on fluctuates with the fortunes of the businesses you invested in.  
<br>
<br>
So, in reality, there is no class of rich people who are separate from the poor.  People's places in those categories fluctuate daily and rise or fall depending on what is going on in the world.  
<br>
<br>
Last year, Hindus in India were coming to America and getting rich in the computer programming industry.  This year, most of them are going home with empty pockets.  China's poor are well on the way to becoming middle class.  Due to their communist past, very few of them started out with money.  A few have made it to the billionaire status.  
<br>
<br>
So, in my view of the world, this dichotomy of rich and poor is an illusion based on a lucky few who have found ways to hang on to what they or their parents or grandparents managed to build over a period of decades.  They become household names while they have money, but nobody remembers them anymore when the money is gone.  But the wealth of people like the Fords (of automobile fame) is tied up in building factories, paying workers, setting up sales forces and paying off politicians.  Most of them own less than 5% of their company's stock.  
<br>
<br>
The vast majority of the stock is held by retirement funds for millions of workers and mutual funds held by millions of investors.  All of those people are wealthy compared to people living in in countries that don't have these vehicles of upward mobility.  
<br>
<br>
So when we start talking about the few who own the vast majority of wealth in the world, we are talking about an illusion.  The Fords don't really own Ford motor company.  Bill and Melinda Gates only own a fraction of Microsoft.  The Hewletts don't own enough of HP to keep management from selling out to Compaq.  If everyone tried to turn their stocks or bonds into money tomorrow, the wealth would evaporate like smoke in a breeze.  
<br>
<br>
When everyone is selling, such value disappears.  It was at risk in the first place.  That's what risk means.  There is a chance you will lose it all in a turn of the market.  You might as well say there is a class of people who hit the lottery every week.  So, what do you think makes them different from you?  </p></td>

<br>
Excellent post, I have no question, and you continue to make sense. Grant, ditto.
<br>
<br>
I would only correct you on one thing: people's wealth is a result of their thinking capacity. Those who inherit their wealth have to match it with their brain capacity to keep it, or else they lose it. 
<br>
<br>
Those who earn wealth, do it through hard work and thinking, not through playing lottery every week. When they lose it, however, it is largely through bad chance. Therefore, there are some who end up keeping their wealth for a long time: those did not get any bad luck, and continued to infuse their wealth with thinking and creativity. You made it seem like the rich were the compulsive gamblers of a country. Quite the opposite: the poor are.
<br>
<br>
P.S. Tomas, where do you live? Scandinavia?</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>One of the things said in the introduction was "technology and theology, science and ethics are often at odds..." I ask why. The examples given, Darwin and Galileo, were conflicts because Darwin and Galileo were right and religious people didn't want to admit that, it conflicted with their previous ideas. What else brings science and ethics into any conflict? Science tends to contradict religious views and that seems to be the only real problem.
<br>
<br>
I tend to agree that the technologies coming on line, genetic engineering, nanotech and AI, are potentially dangerous and that there will be accidents, abuses and oversights. There always are, there always will be. I don't believe they'll destroy humanity -- change it yes, but change it for the better. Yes, we have to be careful about environmental impact, self-replication, and new weapons. We'll have to learn to anticipate the new problems and devise solutions.
<br>
<br>
What I object to is the idea that religion has any worthwhile answers. The idea I get from some panelists is that their religion feels threatened by the new technologies. Several panelists made vague references (Anne Foerrest wasn't all that vague either) to religious concepts. "We'll supplant God." Even Joy said that the so-called "essence of life" is threatened. If what one feels is "the essence of life" feels threatened, maybe it's because you really haven't got a handle on what the "essence" is. Even Kurzweil questions what meaning life can have without death: "We make extraordinary efforts to delay death, and often consider its intrusion tragic. Yet we'd find it hard to live without it. Death gives meaning to our lives."
<br>
<br>
I don't think death gives meaning to life, but it does light a fire under us and limit the time we have to solve our problems. What gives meaning to life is our experiences and what they mean about our world, the people in it, how we relate to them. We find meaning in those experiences. 
<br>
<br>
Forrest says "AI cannot give any answer about the meaning of life and cannot support humans in their intuitive understanding of themselves and within their struggles with their ambiguous and fearful life." Then she suggests religion does give this "meaning." Not for me. AI does have a certain amount of "meaning" to it, it says things about the so called "soul" and our ability to reason. For the rest, I prefer art to religion when it comes to find meaning in life.
<br>
<br>
I might be willing to give Forrest's theologians a chance, but so far all I've heard from them is bullshit. Religion doesn't seem to be any, or have any, kind of answer to me, in fact, it seems to be a big part of the problem. When it comes to terrorism, well, the people who have resorted to it recently have been religious lunatics.  The god of the Old Testament, the root of three religions, is himself a terrorist. Consider the way Moses dealt with Pharaoh -- Moses and God used terrorism. God's business in the Old Testament was terrorism. This is not a good base to start off with.
<br>
<br>
I hope the new technologies do threaten religion -- it's a dangerous thing -- more dangerous than the technologies being discussed.

  God's business in the Old Testament was terrorism. This is not a good base to start off with. 
<br>
<br>
What an interesting point.  I always thought it odd that God commanded that "Thou shalt not kill" and yet killed the first borns in Egyptian households to set the Jews free.  Now, I think the Jews should have been free, but I fail to understand how God wasn't practicing what he was preaching.  Couldn't he find another way to set the Jews free without killing innocent children?
<br>
<br>
&gt; I hope the new technologies do threaten religion -- it's a dangerous thing -- more dangerous than
<br>
   the technologies being discussed. 
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I agree there.  Certainly, religion is the reason for much killing in the world, not to mention what I feel to be child abuse (I remember a mother in a Disney store getting into with me when she heard I was not supportive of her spanking her toddler, as she had just done in the store; I said, "I don't think you'd find it very fair if your boss said to you, "I don't like how you behaved a few minutes ago in the meeting, so if you could please bend over and let me spank you, we can get on with our day."
<br>
<br>
She said, "It's not the same.  The Bible said "Spare the rod and spoil the child.'"
<br>
<br>
I said, "Yeah, well, 99+% of people in our prisons today weren't spared the rod as children, which I think a tad higher than the general population.  I think I'd think I'd rather a spoiled child.  Why don't you do some research and find out the percent of agnostics and atheists in prison today and get back to me?"
<br>
<br>
She walked out of the store.
<br>
<br>
Anyway, as much as I detest people using God as their excuse to kill, grab land and resources, etc., I also am not certain that it is more dangerous than technology (not saying I am certain it isn't - I'm just saying I'm clueless as to which is more dangerous; accidents can happen with technology that can potentially do a lot of damage now).
<br>
<br>
People who believe in God *do* on average live longer and they also seem to be able to handle things that those of us who aren't religious could not handle as easily.  For example, I remember seeing on TV the mother of one of the young children who died on the plane which crashed into the Pentagon...she wasn't mad or crying or anything other than calm, truly believing her daughter to be in heaven, a better place.  I don't have a daughter, but if I did and she was killed (even if she died in some way other than terrorist activity), I'm pretty sure I'd be crying and screaming in agony and a total mess. If I felt I lost a daughter due to some other "human" hands, I would be ranting and raving and furious.
<br>
<br>
I do not have answers, mind you, only questions.</p></td>

<td bgcolor="#DDDDDD" colspan="4"><p>&gt;&gt; The god of the Old Testament... is himself a 
<br>
&gt;&gt; terrorist...
<br>
&gt; What an interesting point. I always thought it odd 
<br>
&gt; that God commanded that "Thou shalt not kill"...
<br>
<br>
That's what it says in the King James version, other versions translate it as "thou shalt not murder." Apparently killing people isn't murder if you think God tells you to do it.
<br>
<br>
&gt;... and yet killed the first borns in Egyptian 
<br>
&gt; households to set the Jews free. 
<br>
<br>
If it were a religion of peace, well, God wasn't as smart as Ghandi it seems when it comes to peaceful change and revolution. Like I said, the God of the Old Testament is a terrorist, and not just Moses out of Egypt, but Sodom, Babel etc., all terrorist actions. The New Testament doesn't have Jesus doing any terrorist actions, just threatening them for the future.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Now, I think the Jews should have been free, 
<br>
&gt; but I fail to understand how God wasn't 
<br>
&gt; practicing what he was preaching. Couldn't he 
<br>
&gt; find another way to set the Jews free without 
<br>
&gt; killing innocent children? 
<br>
<br>
Ghandi found a way, and I see no reason it wouldn't have worked for the Jews, or for Osama bin Laden. The Jews could have simply gone on strike from doing whatever it was they did for the Egyptians. Bin Laden could have had his followers lay down in the roads in front of those American bases he wanted out of Saudi Arabia... Yes, there are better ways. Unless you're God, terrorism usually doesn't work. It's a rather stupid thing to do.
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I hope the new technologies do threaten religion 
<br>
&gt;&gt; -- it's a dangerous thing -- more dangerous than 
<br>
&gt;&gt; the technologies being discussed. 
<br>
&gt;
<br>
&gt; I'm not sure if I agree there. Certainly, religion 
<br>
&gt; is the reason for much killing... She said, "It's 
<br>
&gt; not the same. The Bible said "Spare the rod and 
<br>
&gt; spoil the child.'"... Why don't you do some research 
<br>
&gt; and find out the percent of agnostics and atheists 
<br>
&gt; in prison today and get back to me?" 
<br>
<br>
Terroristic parenting? Does it make terrorists of the
<br>
children? I wander how bin Laden was raised?
<br>
<br>
&gt; I'm just saying I'm clueless as to which is more 
<br>
&gt; dangerous; accidents can happen with technology that 
<br>
&gt; can potentially do a lot of damage now). 
<br>
<br>
Yea, accidents happen, but so do things insurance companies call "acts of God," like tornados and such. On the whole, it seems science and technology save more lives than they take because we get weather warnings as well as cures for diseases.
<br>
<br>
&gt; People who believe in God *do* on average live 
<br>
&gt; longer...
<br>
<br>
Illusions can protect us from facing reality head on. Facing reality head on does, apparently, take its toll on us.
<br>
<br>
&gt;... and they also seem to be able to handle things ...
<br>
&gt; mother of one of the young children who died ...
<br>
&gt; ...she wasn't mad or crying or anything other than 
<br>
&gt; calm, truly believing her daughter to be in heaven,...
<br>
&gt;... If I felt I lost a daughter due to some other 
<br>
&gt; "human" hands, I would be ranting and raving and 
<br>
&gt; furious. 
<br>
<br>
I didn't even lose anyone and I was furious and raving a bit after I saw the news.
<br>
<br>
&gt; I do not have answers, mind you, only questions.
<br>
<br>
I don't really have any complete answers myself, but some things just seem pretty damn obvious. That religion is a big problem in the modern world seems to be obvious to me. What I can't answer is why so few other people don't see it too.
<br>
<br>
One of these days I will write a book about all the dangerous aspects of religion.</p></td>

I had no idea the other translations were different on this point.  You can tell I am not a Bible afficianado (heck, I can't even spell the word!).

<br>
Good points.  The problem is some people literally get off by harming others, like someone (an Arab feeling he was fighting a holy war, I believe)  I read was screaming in ecstasy while stabbing someone.  That sort of sickness is not as rare as some might think.  It could be why some opt for violent measures even when others could work even better.
<br>
<br>
&gt; Terroristic parenting? Does it make terrorists of the 
<br>
   children? I wander how bin Laden was raised? 
<br>
<br>
I sort of thought bin Laden didn't get much attention, being one of oodles of children and not even close to a first born, but maybe he was getting attention from servants or something and it was not of a compassionate nature, who knows.  Maybe he is just a bad seed, but one who feels he is doing what is right, which I confess I feel is better than those who harm others only to get something for themselves (and bin Laden might be that sort instead, I really don't know).

<br>
<br>
To date, I think technology has saved more lives that it has taken, but that doesn't mean such will always be the case.  Things change.  Even though the best predictor of the future is the past, it's not 100% by a long shot.
<br>

True.
<br>
<br>
&gt;  I didn't even lose anyone and I was furious and raving a bit after I saw the news. 
<br>
<br>
I think many men were (perhaps many women, too, but not as many ratio wise, seemed to me).  I was angry, no question, but not as much as I would have been had I known someone who died.  Logically, it should be the same level of anger either way, but that logical I guess I am not.

I see that religion is a big problem in the modern world.  I'm just not as sure that it isn't also a solution for some, who might feel terribly hopeless otherwise and be worse off without having this faith that what is happening is somehow for
